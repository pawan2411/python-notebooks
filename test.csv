LI,13796303-Mariana--Millais,By Mitchel Conner
H2,13796303-Mariana--Millais,Freeman-Rice
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"Mariana is an 1851 oil-on-wood painting by John Everett Millais. The image is based on the solitary Mariana from William Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"", written between 1601 and 1606. In the play, Mariana was to be married, but was rejected when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck. Her story was retold in ""Mariana"", a poem published in 1830 by Tennyson, which provided additional inspiration for Millais' painting. The painting is regarded as an example of Millais' ""precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist""."
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"Millais was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before Raphael—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate."
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"When it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851, the display caption contained lines from Tennyson's ""Mariana"" (1830):"
H1,13796303-Mariana--Millais,<poem>
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"    She only said, 'My life is dreary,"
LI,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"      He cometh not,' she said;"
LI,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"    She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,'"
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,      I would that I were dead!'
H1,13796303-Mariana--Millais,</poem>
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"The painting is packed with details that help the viewer to read the narrative of the work along with Tennyson's poetry. Everything from the rolled embroidery that Mariana has been working on and the leaves outside of the window point the reader in the direction of the narrative which is about a young woman rejected by her fiancé because her dowry was lost at sea. It is about waiting and the passage of time, which Millais shows by the arched-back pose of the woman. The pose makes it seem like she has been sitting too long and she must stand up to stretch before she sits again. The rolled embroidery on the table gives the viewer a clue as to how long Mariana has been working on it."
PA,13796303-Mariana--Millais,"In the painting ""Mariana"", Millais included many details that relate directly to Tennyson's poetry. One example is the curtain. In the poem, Tennyson wrote, ""When thickest dark did trance the sky, She drew her casement-curtain by, and glanced athwart the glooming flats"". Although there is not a curtain in Millais' painting, this line is similar to the scene that is presented outside of the window. The viewer perceives an ominous feeling, just like the dark storm that Tennyson alludes to in the line above. The little mouse that is on the floor towards the bottom right corner is a detail that Millais took from Tennyson's poem: ""the mouse behind the mouldering wainscots shriek'd or from the crevice peer'd about"". Together, Millais' painting and Tennyson's poem create an intriguing storyline for the reader to follow."

Early meetings were held in downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland. The membership quickly showed the oil and gas industry an ability to produce superior geological publications. This capability has continued to the present time."
PA,17770189-Pittsburgh-Geological-Society,"Dinner meetings in the fifties through seventies generally featured topics of interest to the oil and gas community. The emphasis on oil and gas has changed to a broad range of geologically related subjects including environmental, geo-technical, and coal/mineral resources. The speakers at these meetings have been top quality. This has enabled the society to attract professionals from a broad range of interests."

The plan was endorsed by the Sixtieth World Health Assembly on May 23, 2007 because of several concerns. First, workers represent a significant contribution to the world's economic and social development. Furthermore, an international disparity between countries of occupational hazard prevention and access to occupational health services was observed.

LI,1100880-WowWee,"WowWee Group Limited, is a privately owned, Hong Kong-based Canadian consumer technology company."
H1,1100880-WowWee,History
PA,1100880-WowWee,"Initially from Canada, the two founding brothers (Richard and Peter Yanofsky) moved to Hong Kong to form the company in 1982, as an independent research & development and manufacturing outfit. As an OEM seller, they produced products such as the Power Rangers Power Gloves and the Talking Tots dolls. In 1987, the company changed focus, building and marketing toys under their own brand in response to a fall in OEM orders. They produced new products including a robotic dog (MegaByte), T-Rex, and the Animaltronics and Dinotronics lines of remote control animals. In 1998 the company was purchased by Hasbro."
LI,1100880-WowWee,Under Hasbro
PA,1100880-WowWee,"Shortly before the Hasbro sale, Peter Yanofsky reportedly caught physicist/roboticist Mark Tilden on the Discovery Channel, and soon hired him as a consultant. Initially Tilden worked part-time with WowWee while he continued his work with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, but in 2001, Tilden joined the company full-time. One of his first products with WowWee was the B.I.O. Bug, released in 2001. Unfortunately, while sales were good they weren't as strong as either WowWee or Hasbro would have liked. In part this has been attributed to the after-effects of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, while Tilden has also expressed disappointment with some of the limitations placed on the product design by Hasbro. After moving to WowWee full-time in 2001, Tilden focused his attention on developing Robosapien."
PA,1100880-WowWee,"While Tilden was developing Robosapien, Hasbro canceled the project several times, leading Yanofsky to negotiate out of the contract in 2003. Robosapien was released in 2004, and over 1.5 million were reportedly sold in the first five months of sale. Robosapien was the first commercially available biomorphic robot, and the first to integrate personality-like features. Tilden continued to develop the line with the Robosapien V2 (released in 2005), which added functionality like speech capability; RS Media™ robot (released in 2006), which included user-created functions, and Roboreptile (also in 2006). The Roboquad a four-wheeled robot (released in 2007); the RS Tri-Bot, a three-wheeled robot (released in summer 2008), and RS Media (2006)."
PA,1100880-WowWee,"In 2007, working with inventor Sean Frawley, WowWee released the FlyTech Dragonflya remote control flying ornithopter. The Dragonfly was named as one of the inventions of the year by Time in 2007. The success of the Dragonfly led to other flying toys, such as the Bladestar (a remote controlled helicopter) and the Butterfly (a wind-up ornithopter aimed at younger children)."

WowWee denied any wrongdoing and asserted that the shapes Gibson claimed as trademarks were generic and therefore could not function as trademarks. On November 24, 2010, the court denied Gibson's request for a temporary restraining order, but on December 22, 2010, granted Gibson's motion for a preliminary injunction. The case was later settled, with WowWee paying Gibson an undisclosed amount for licensing the likeness of Gibson guitars, according to Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz."

PA,17295909-1994-Stanley-Cup-playoffs,"The 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs, the championship of the National Hockey League (NHL), began after the conclusion of the 1993–94 NHL season. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played best-of-seven game series for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships; and then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup. The playoffs ended when the New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in the seventh game of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals."
PA,17295909-1994-Stanley-Cup-playoffs,"For the first time since joining the NHL, all four former WHA teams (Edmonton, Hartford, Quebec, and Winnipeg) failed to make the playoffs. Wayne Gretzky also missed the playoffs for the first time in his career. Conversely, the San Jose Sharks became the first post-1990 expansion team to make the playoffs. All series played between Central and Pacific Division teams had a 2–3–2 format to reduce travel. This was the last Canadian team appearance in the Final until 2004, and as of the end of 2017–18, remains the most recent time that two Canadian teams made it to the conference finals in the same year."

LI,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,Leptopelis yaldeni
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,"Leptopelis yaldeni is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is endemic to Ethiopia and occurs in the montane highlands in Gojjam. Its range might be limited by the deep gorges of the Blue Nile. It is named in honour of Derek Yalden, a British zoologist who collected some of the types. Common names Yalden's tree frog and grassland forest treefrog have been coined for this species."
H1,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,Description
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,"Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The habitus is relatively slender. The snout is moderate, slightly pointed in profile. The tympanum is round and fairly conspicuous. Digital discs are of moderate size. The webbing between the toes and the two outermost fingers is moderate."
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,"This species has two colour morphs. One form is dorsally brown (ranging from pale cream or golden, sometimes greenish, through shades of grey-brown or red-brown to dark purplish-brown), typically with darker markings with that may be prominent; the pattern includes an often incomplete interorbital bar and a triangular dorsal mark. The other morph is bright green (bright blue-green or yellow green, rarely silver-green or pale to dark olive); dorsal markings are usually absent. The green form dominates at the upper end of the altitude range of this species where the habitats are more open, whereas the brown morph is only present at lower altitudes where the habitat has more cover."
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,The male advertisement call is a series of screams followed by a click.
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,"The tadpole have a short, deep body and relatively long tail. The largest specimen, with budding hindlimbs, measures in total length."
H1,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,Habitat and conservation
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,"""Leptopelis yaldeni"" occurs in montane grasslands and moderately degraded habitats such as rural settlements at elevations of above sea level. Breeding typically takes place close to the banks of small streams. Males call from exposed positions; if tall vegetation is available, they will often choose to call from elevated positions, but they may also call from on the ground if the pool margin is bare earth. The eggs are deposited in nests on land near the water, and the tadpoles develop in the water."
PA,12382741-Leptopelis-yaldeni,"""Leptopelis yaldeni"" is common and even abundant at many sites. Although it tolerates some habitat modification, it is likely that intensification of urbanization and agriculture will negatively impact this species. It is not known to occur in any protected areas."

PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"The King v. Lukens, 1 U.S. 5 (1762) is a decision of a Pennsylvania Provincial Court, (probably the Supreme Court) issued when Pennsylvania was still an English colony. It is among the first decisions that appear in the first volume of United States Reports."
LI,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,Colonial and early State Court cases in the United States Reports
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"None of the decisions appearing in the first volume and most of the second volume of the United States Reports are actually decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Instead, they are decisions from various Pennsylvania courts, dating from the colonial period and the first decade after Independence. Alexander Dallas, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania lawyer and journalist, had been in the business of reporting these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began compiling his case reports in a bound volume, which he called ""Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and since the Revolution"". This would come to be known as the first volume of ""Dallas Reports""."
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"When the United States Supreme Court, along with the rest of the new Federal Government, moved in 1791 to the nation's temporary capital in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme Court's first unofficial and unpaid Supreme Court Reporter. (Court reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second volume of his Reports, and when the Supreme Court began hearing cases, he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the second volume, ""2 Dallas Reports"". Dallas would go on to publish a total of 4 volumes of decisions during his tenure as Reporter."
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"In 1874, the U.S. government created the United States Reports, and numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of that series, starting from the first volume of Dallas Reports. The four volumes Dallas published were retitled volumes 1 - 4 of United States Reports. As a result, the complete citation to ""The King v. Lukens"" is 1 U.S. 5 (1 Dallas 5) (1760)."
H1,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,The decision
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"According to Dallas's annotations, John Lukens had been indicted by a grand jury for nuisance. A statute enacted in 1705 and in force when this indictment was issued, required that any indictment be endorsed by the prosecutor."
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"However, grand juries in that age had far more power and acted far more independently than they generally do today. Any person, not merely the prosecutor, could bring a criminal complaint to a grand jury for its consideration, and the grand jury could conduct its own investigation into alleged criminal behavior before handing down an indictment. Thus, it was not uncommon for a grand jury to proceed to indictment without any involvement by a prosecutor whatsoever. The indictment against Lukens appears to have been just such a case. One note suggests that a constable may have presented a complaint or case to the grand jury, for there is mention of a constable's return after the indictment was issued by the grand jury."
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"The question before the court was whether the prosecution against Lukens could proceed without the endorsement of the prosecutor. Lukens' attorney, a Mr. Dickerson, argued that the statute required the naming or endorsement of a prosecutor before Lukens should have to plead to the charge, the first stage of a criminal prosecution. Mr. Chew, the Attorney General, argued that the statute only intended that a prosecutor be named where there was a prosecutor on the case. Otherwise, Chew argued, a prosecutor need not be so endorsed. Dickerson's position, he noted, would result in many criminals escaping justice, as many cases were brought by grand juries and justices of the peace without the participation of a prosecutor."
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"The court agreed with Chew, ruled that a prosecutor need be named only when and where a prosecutor in involved, and directed Lukens to answer the plea."
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,Little else is known about the case against Lukens.
H1,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,Precedential effect
PA,16219798-The-King-v--Lukens,"Over a century and a half after ""The King v. Lukens"" was decided, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in the case of ""United States v. Wetmore"" 218 F. 227 (1914) would cite Lukens as precedent for the proposition that no endorsement of a prosecutor was necessary where no person was actively carrying on the prosecution. In that case, indictments were brought by a grand jury investigating alleged fraud against the United States by contractors provided substandard materials for the Panama Canal project. Once again, a grand jury, rather than a prosecutor (in this case the United States Attorney), initiated criminal proceedings, and once again, the indictment was without a prosecutor's endorsement. And again, a court held that if there is no prosecutor, the indictment need not be endorse by one."

PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"Jure Grando Alilović or Giure Grando (1579 – 1656) was a villager from the region of Istria (in modern-day Croatia) who may have been the first real person described as a vampire in historical records. He was referred to as a ""strigoi"", ""štrigon"" or ""štrigun"", a local word for something resembling a vampire and a warlock."
H1,10220010-Jure-Grando,History
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"Jure Grando lived in Kringa, a small town in the interior of the Istrian peninsula near Tinjan. He died in 1656 due to illness but according to legend, returned from the grave at night as a vampire (""štrigon"") and terrorised his village until his decapitation in 1672. Ana and Nikola Alilović, daughter and son of Jure, fled from Istria to Volterra, Italy at young ages."
H1,10220010-Jure-Grando,Legend
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"The legend tells that, for 16 years after his death, Jure would arise from his grave by night and terrorise the village. The village priest, Giorgio, who had buried Jure sixteen years previously discovered that at night somebody would knock on the doors around the village, and on whichever door he knocked, someone from that house would die within the next few days."
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"Jure also appeared to his terrified widow in her bedroom, who described the corpse as looking as though he was smiling and gasping for breath, and would then sexually assault her. When Father Giorgio eventually came face to face with the vampire, he held out a cross in front of him and yelled ""Behold Jesus Christ, you vampire! Stop tormenting us!"""
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"The bravest of the villagers led by the prefect Miho Radetić chased and tried to kill the vampire by piercing his heart with a hawthorn stick, but failed because the stick just bounced off of his chest. One night later, nine people went to the graveyard, carrying a cross, lamps and a hawthorn stick. They dug up Jure's coffin, and found a perfectly preserved corpse with a smile on its face. Father Giorgio said: ""Look, ""štrigon"", there is Jesus Christ who saved us from hell and died for us. And you, ""štrigon"", you cannot have peace!"" They then tried to pierce its heart again, but the stick could not penetrate its flesh."
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"After some exorcism prayers, Stipan Milašić (one of the villagers), took a saw and sawed the head off the corpse. As soon as the saw tore his skin, the vampire screamed and blood started to flow from the cut. According to folklore, peace finally returned to the region after Jure's decapitation."
H1,10220010-Jure-Grando,Writings
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"Carniolan scientist Janez Vajkard Valvasor wrote about Jure Grando Alilović's life and afterlife in his extensive work ""The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola"" when he visited Kringa during his travels. This was the first written document on vampires. Grando was also mentioned in writings by Erasmus Francisci and Johann Joseph von Goerres (""La mystique divine, naturelle, et diabolique"", Paris 1855), whose story was much more elaborate, full of fantastic details to make the story more interesting and sensational. In modern times, Croatian writer Boris Perić has researched the legend and written a book (""The Vampire"") on the story."
H1,10220010-Jure-Grando,Modern times
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"Today, Kringa has embraced the story of Jure Grando Alilović and have opened up a vampire themed bar aimed at attracting tourists to the town. The Juraj Dobrila gymnasium in Pazin created a short film called ""Vampire of My Homeland"" (""Vampir moga zavičaja"") based on the writings from Valvasor."
PA,10220010-Jure-Grando,"The folklore related to the ""štrigun"" has recently been documented and examined by numerous scientists at the University of Zagreb."

H1,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,Brief
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"The Victorian Farmers' Union (VFU) was an association of farmers and primary producers formed in 1914 in the Australian state of Victoria. Although initially formed as an ""absolutely non-political"" entity, the VFU became a political party in 1916, and nominated candidates for the 1917 state election and subsequent elections. In later years it used the names Victorian Country Party, then United Country Party and is now the National Party of Australia – Victoria. At the 1917 election, because the support for the VFU was concentrated in rural seats, it won four of the 11 seats in the Victorian Legislative Assembly it contested, gaining about 6% of the vote state-wide. In 1918 it also won its first seat in the federal parliament, after preferential voting was introduced. At the 1920 state election the VFU vote increased to 8% and the number of seats to 13, giving the VFU the balance of power in the state Legislative Assembly."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"The VFU was a precursor to the Country Party in Victoria, which merged with other state parties to become the federal Country Party, later the National Party of Australia. The VFU is a member of the National Farmers' Federation."
H1,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,Proposal and formation
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,The proposal to form the Union was made in a meeting of several farmers at Thorburn's Hotel in Woodend on 18 April 1914.
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,The attendants at the meeting agreed upon the following resolutions regarding the formation of the association:
LI,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,That a Victorian Farmers' Union be formed.
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,That the qualification of membership be that they are legitimate farmers.
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,That the basis of union be absolutely non-political in the party sense.
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,The meeting also outlined the union's objectives:
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,To safeguard and promote the common interests of all primary producers in the State.
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"To meet labour unionism in industrial disputes with the spirit of reason and justice, and at the same time place ourselves in the best position to resist any unfair demands or unreasonable conditions being placed upon us."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,By the application of the co-operative principle on safe and economic lines we propose to guard against the withering influence of monopolistic combinations of every form.
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"The VFU was inaugurated, and held its first public meeting at Newham on 5 June 1914. While its first executive officers were appointed at this time, the VFU did little active organisation over the next two years due to the outbreak of World War I. In 1916, the VFU merged with the Farmers' Union of Victoria, an organisation with a similar name and objective, which had formed in the northern districts and was based in Melbourne. At the time of the merger, ""party politics"" were still prohibited as per the original resolutions, although the VFU agreed to formulate a political policy in its first conference held during Show Week later in the year. At the conference, which began on 26 September, the executive recommended that the VFU gain a parliamentary presence by admitting existing members of parliament. The proposal was rejected by the delegates, and instead it was agreed that members must join the VFU before being endorsed and nominated to stand for parliament at the next state election."
H1,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,Growth and political activity
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"At the time of the inaugural conference, the VFU consisted of 130 branches and 2,836 members, drawing its most enthusiastic (and militant) support from farmers in the wheat-growing districts of the Mallee region. From 1917 to 1920, the VFU rapidly accumulated members from amongst graziers, dairy farmers and orchardists, and by 1920 had 547 branches and 14,817 members."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"On 26 September 1917, at its conference in Geelong, the VFU passed a motion to change the name of its political wing from the Victorian Farmers' Union Party to the Country Party. The party fought the 1917 Victorian state election as the Farmers' Union. It contested eleven seats in the Legislative Assembly, of which it won four: Grenville, Korong, Rodney and Swan Hill. At the 1920 state election the Farmers' Union's vote increased to 8% and the number of seats to 13, giving the Union the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly. In 1921, the Union caused the dissolution of Parliament after it voted with Labor against the Nationalist government, over the issue of abolishing the state-run wheat-marketing system which had been introduced during World War I, and which benefited small farmers by keeping wheat prices high. At the 1921 state election, the Union increased its vote to 14% but the number of seats dropped to 12, and it continued to hold the balance of power. It would retain that position until 1952."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"In September 1923, Harry Lawson formed a composite ministry, Victoria's first conservative coalition, and bringing the VFU into government, with five members, with John Allan as Deputy Premier. The VFU, however, refused to support the coalition and voted it down at its annual conference in March 1924, forcing Lawson to dismiss the Country ministers and form a Nationalist cabinet."
H1,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,Splits and reconciliations
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"In 1925, the VFU suffered a major setback when John Hall (the party's candidate in the Flinders by-election), and its former core support base of Mallee wheat farmers, split from the VFU and formed a new organisation, the Primary Producers' Union (PPU). Hall, as the PPU general secretary, stated that the PPU was formed due to the lack of political unity within the VFU, as well as the failure of the parliamentary party to pursue the group's objectives, including compulsory organised marketing of primary products, reduction of tariff duties, establishment of a rural bank, and resisting centralisation."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"The PPU announced it would contest all electorates in Victoria's northern wheat belt at the 1927 state election as the Country Progressive Party. At its annual conference in late March 1927, the VFU responded by changing its name to the Victorian Country Party. The new party had a broader membership, which included all ""bona fide country residents"" of any occupation, whereas membership of VFU had been restricted to primary producers only. At the 1927 election, the Victorian Country Party won 10 seats, while the Country Progressive Party won four. The Progressives and one independent supported Edmond Hogan's Labor party into government. In 1928 the support was withdrawn and the Nationalists formed government with VCP support. Labor won the 1929 state election, and the two Country parties eventually reconciled and merged to form the United Country Party in 1930."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"Another split in the UCP took place in 1937, following the expulsion of Victorian federal MP John McEwen for supporting the federal Coalition government. McEwen's supporters formed the Liberal Country Party in Victoria and were loyal to the federal party, while the UCP remained loyal to the state party and the Victorian United Country Party Premier Albert Dunstan. The breach was resolved by 1943."
H1,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,Federal activities
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"The VFU also made several forays into federal politics. The VFU nominated John Hall for the Flinders by-election held in May 1918, as a ""spoiler"" strategy, threatening to split the non-Labor vote. After gaining a promise from the Nationalist Party led by Billy Hughes to replace the first-past-the-post electoral system with preferential voting, the VFU made a ""strategic defeat"", withdrawing Hall from the campaign. (Hall's name remained on the ballot paper and he received 382 votes (1.7 per cent).) After seeing the impact of a split conservative vote at the Western Australian Swan by-election held in October 1918, the federal Nationalist government quickly introduced preferential voting in time for the Corangamite by-election held in December 1918, enabling the VFU's candidate, William Gibson, to defeat the Labor candidate (future Prime Minister James Scullin) on preferences despite being over 4,000 behind on primary votes, thereby gaining the VFU its first member of the federal House of Representatives."
PA,14168077-Victorian-Farmers--Union,"It gained a second member in the 1919 federal election, when Robert Cook ousted the Nationalist incumbent in Indi. In 1920, Gibson and Cook joined other rural MPs from New South Wales and Western Australia in forming the Australian Country Party led by William McWilliams from Tasmania, who held pro-rural views though not previously nominated by a state related rural party. At the time the Country Party had 11 members. Following the 1922 federal election, the Nationalists lost its majority in the House of Representatives and formed a Coalition government with the Country Party, now with 14 members, which obtained five ministers in an 11-member cabinet."

PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae, also published as ""On the Proteaceae of Jussieu"", was a paper written by Robert Brown on the taxonomy of the plant family Proteaceae. It was read to the Linnean Society of London in the first quarter of 1809, and published in March 1810. It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics."
H1,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,Background
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"Brown had been botanist during Matthew Flinders' circumnavigation of Australia, and since returning in England in 1805 he had been preparing descriptions of the specimens collected during the voyage. Brown's intention was to publish a flora of Australia, but this was still incomplete in September 1808 when Jonas Dryander asked Brown to write a monograph on the Proteaceae so that Dryander could use Brown's names in a new edition of ""Hortus Kewensis"". Brown immediately set to work researching the topic."
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"In preparing the paper, Brown had unfettered access to the herbarium of his patron, Sir Joseph Banks, which included the specimens he had collected during Flinders' voyage, and which contained the most extensive collection of Proteaceae in the world. He was also given access to James Edward Smith's Linnean collection; the herbarium of Aylmer Bourke Lambert; the living collections of George Hibbert; the herbarium of William Aiton, which contained the collections of Francis Masson; and the collections of William Roxburgh. In addition he was accorded a brief examination of the specimens collected by Jacques Labillardière at Esperance Bay, on the southwest coast of Australia, where Brown had not collected."

PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"Brown's paper was read to the Linnean Society of London in four parts, on 17 January, 7 February, 21 February and 7 March 1809. The Council of the Society approved it for publication on 2 May, but it did not appear in print until 8 March 1810. It was published as a separate offprint under the title ""On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae"", and then appeared in Volume 10, Part 1 of ""Transactions of the Linnean Society of London"", under the title ""On the Proteaceae of Jussieu"". It was illustrated by two Ferdinand Bauer plates, depicting ""Knightia excelsa"" and ""Dryandra formosa"" (now ""Banksia formosa"")."
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"The paper begins with a digression, presenting Brown's observations on undeveloped Asclepiadaceae flowers as evidence of the importance of studying developing flowers as well as mature ones. It then discusses the biogeography of Proteaceae, noting the southern hemisphere (that is, Gondwanan) distribution of the family, and that ""[t]he most numerous genera are also the most widely diffused."" Brown then discusses the morphology of the family, including a discussion of pollen shape; according to David Mabberley this represents ""the first major study of the subject, palynology""."
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"The systematics section follows, and is most important for the large number of new taxa published therein. 404 species in 38 genera are listed. 18 of the genera are new, and nearly all of these are still upheld. The arrangement of these genera largely follows that introduced by Richard Salisbury in his 1806 ""The Paradisus Londinensis"", although Brown asserts that he arrived at his arrangement independently. Brown does introduce one important concept, however: his division of the Proteaceae into two subfamilies based on whether or not the fruit dehisces. This is still considered the fundamental division in the family, though opinion has varied on whether the defining character should be fruit dehiscence or paired flowers."
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"Overall, the paper was very well received; according to Mabberley, ""[t]he paper was masterful and commanded respect for Brown as a brilliant botanist."""
H1,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,Controversy
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"Shortly after the reading of ""On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae"", but before it appeared in print, there appeared a publication that started one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany. This was ""On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae"", ostensibly by Joseph Knight. Despite the title, this paper contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. Although not explicitly attributed, it was widely believed, and is still so, that this revision was contributed by Richard Salisbury, who had been present at all four of the meetings at which Brown read his paper. The revision contains many of the plant names that Brown had presented to the Linnean Society; for example, the genera ""Petrophile"", ""Isopogon"" and ""Grevillea"". Thus Salisbury beat Brown to print, claiming priority for the names that Brown had authored. Salisbury is also accused of having appropriated some of Brown's observations; for example, in the Linnean Society copy of Knight's paper, where Salisbury says that he suspects that the fruit of ""Persoonia"" is unusual, Brown has pencilled in ""He suspects it because he listened very attentively to my paper when read at the Linnean Society."""
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"Salisbury was accused of plagiarism and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letters indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, Samuel Goodenough wrote ""How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!""; and James Edward Smith wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper ""but shall not keep it—I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions."" Brown himself wrote of Salisbury ""I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool."""
PA,19286928-On-the-natural-order-of-plants-called-Proteaceae,"With the passage of time, some dissenting views have emerged. In 1870, Charles Babbington wrote that ""Knight's Proteaceae is very curious if the best part of it was really carried away from a Linnean meeting and appropriated by Salisbury to tease R. Brown""; and other authors have since denied Salisbury's involvement. In 1886, James Britten noted that Smith had earlier deliberately acted to suppress a genus name published by Salisbury, and that there was an understanding among botanical leaders of the period, including Brown, Banks and Smith, that Salisbury's names should be ignored, partly because Salisbury supported de Jussieu's natural system of classification rather than the sexual system of Linnaeus. In 1985 David Mabberley offered the following in Salisbury's defence: ""If Salisbury was guilty, why did he do it? ... [N]o doubt Salisbury felt that Brown was encroaching on his territory, for he had been writing on, and studying, Proteaceae for some time, and here was the Librarian of Smith's Linnean Society dashing off a paper to get his names into ""Hortus kewensis"", criticizing Salisbury and abandoning some of his names on the way. It seems not inconceivable, therefore, that Salisbury... would have made amendments to Knight's final manuscript in the light of Brown's remarks... and hurried it through the press to defeat the machinations of his enemy."""

PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"Block Island Southeast Light is a lighthouse located on Mohegan Bluffs at the southeastern corner of Block Island, Rhode Island. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1997 as one of the most architecturally sophisticated lighthouses built in the United States in the 19th century."
H1,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,Description and History
PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"Although Congress appropriated $9,000 to build this light in 1856, the funds were used to build a new Block Island North Light after the old one was washed away in a storm. This light was finally built in 1874, with the lamp first lit on February 1, 1875. It is a sophisticated expression of the Gothic Revival executed in brick, and was a marked contrast to earlier lighthouses, which were generally more functional in appearance. The main tower is in height, with an octagonal granite foundation and brick exterior, which rises to a cast iron parapet and open gallery around the lantern chamber. This is topped by a sixteen-sided pyramidal copper roof with a ball ventilator and lightning rod. The original roof was cast iron, and was replaced in 1994."
PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"The keeper's house is attached to the tower by a 1-1/2 story connecting wing. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure with identical projecting 1-1/2 story kitchen wings at its rear, and a steeply-pitched gable roof with windows extending into the roofline. There are porches on either side of the connector, one for each of the two dwellings in the building, which were originally identical. That on the southwest side has retained original trim, which includes beveled, bracketed posts. The north wing was designated for the keeper, while the south wing was for his assistants. The only major alterations to the residences have been for the introduction of modern plumbing (in 1938) and the repair of storm-related damage. The roof was originally shingled, and since been covered by a variety of materials, most recently slate shingles."
PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"The original optic was a first order Fresnel lens standing about tall with four circular wicks burning lard (pig) oil. The lard oil was replaced by kerosene in the 1880s. The lens was modified in 1929 to rotate floating on a pool of mercury, at first driven by a clockwork mechanism, which was replaced by a small electric motor."
PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"In 1990, the Coast Guard deactivated the light and replaced it with a nearby steel tower. Because of ongoing erosion of the bluffs, in 1993 the entire 2,000 ton structure was moved about back from the cliffs. After the move, the Coast Guard decided not to retain the rotating mercury float lens, but instead installed the first order fixed lens which had been removed in 1980 from the Cape Lookout Lighthouse. Ownership of the lighthouse was transferred in 1992 to the Southeast Lighthouse Foundation, which is dedicated to its preservation."
PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The latter designation was made in recognition of the light's historic importance as an aid to navigation, and for its sophisticated architecture, which was only matched by the Cleveland Light, which was demolished in the early 20th century. As of its 1997 designation, it was one of only twelve lighthouses which used a first-order Fresnel lens."
H1,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,Museum
PA,1957309-Block-Island-Southeast-Light,"The lighthouse has a small museum and gift shop in the base of the tower. The tower is open during the summer season offering guided tours to the top, for a fee of ten dollars as of September 2015. Proceeds from tours are used for restoration of the lighthouse."

H2,1305155-Aesti,Aesti
H1,1305155-Aesti,Brief
PA,1305155-Aesti,"The Aesti (also Aestii, Astui or Aests) were an ancient people first described by the Roman historian Tacitus in his treatise ""Germania"" (circa 98 AD). According to Tacitus, the territory of Aesti was located somewhere east of the ""Suiones"" (Swedes) and west of the ""Sitones"" (possibly the ancient ""Kvens""), on the Suebian (Baltic) Sea. This and other evidence suggests that they lived in or near the present-day Russian enclave of Kaliningrad Oblast (previously East Prussia)."
PA,1305155-Aesti,"Despite the phonological similarity between ""Aestii"" and the modern ethnonyms of Estonia, especially in popular etymologies, the two geographical areas are not contiguous and there are few, if any, direct historical links between them."
H1,1305155-Aesti,Overview
PA,1305155-Aesti,"Geographical and linguistic evidence suggests that the Aesti were, ethnologically, a Baltic people. They may have been synonymous with the ""Brus/Prūsa"" or ""Old Prussians"" – that is, not a Germanic people like modern Prussians, and not a Finno-Ugric people, such as modern Estonians. Tacitus almost certainly erred in implying that the Aesti were a hybrid Celtic-Germanic culture: he claimed that while the ""Aestian nations"" followed the ""same customs and attire"" as ""the Suebians"" (at the time a collective term for eastern Germanic peoples), their speech resembled that of the Britons (i.e., a Celtic language rather than the Germanic languages of the Suebii). Tacitus often utilised unreliable, secondary sources, and may not have been aware of such distinctions in any case."
PA,1305155-Aesti,"Tacitus' mention of a cult of the mother of the gods among the Aesti along the eastern Baltic coast does apply to the ancient Estonian and Baltic pagan religions. He also refers to the Fenni living next to the Aesti—the Fenni being ancestors to the Finns or the Sámi would situate them closest to the Estonians. Ultimately, Tacitus' use of Aesti could apply equally well to either a specific people or to a grouping of ethnically diverse peoples across a wider area ."
PA,1305155-Aesti,"In the modern Estonian language, ""Eesti"" is the endonym for ""Estonia"". Estonia was known as ""Estia"" or ""Hestia"" in some early Latin sources, and ""Eistland"" in ancient Scandinavian sagas. Estonians themselves used ""Maarahvas"", meaning people of the land, to refer to themselves until the early modern era. The etymologies of Aesti and Eesti remain subjects of scholarly conjecture."
PA,1305155-Aesti,"Tacitus is also credited with recording the only surviving example of the Aestian language: ""glesum"", an apparently Latinised word for amber and similar to the later Latvian equivalent: ""glīsis"" or ""glēsa"". Both may be loanwords from a Germanic language, given their similarity to the Gothic word ""glas""."
PA,1305155-Aesti,"There is evidence that the area around the Vistula Lagoon was strongly associated with the Aesti: the Old Prussian and modern Lithuanian names for the lagoon, ""Aīstinmari"" and ""Aistmarės"" respectively, appear to be derived from ""Aesti"" and ""mari"" (""lagoon"" or ""fresh water bay""). Therefore, the oldest known name of the body of the water was ""lagoon of the Aesti""."
H1,1305155-Aesti,Historical sources
H1,1305155-Aesti,Tacitus
PA,1305155-Aesti,"The ancient writers, beginning with Tacitus, who was the first Roman author to mention them in his ""Germania"", provide very little information on the Aestii. Although Tacitus never travelled to Magna Germania himself and only recorded information he had obtained from others, the short ethnographic excursus below is the most detailed ancient account of the Aestii that we have:"
PA,1305155-Aesti,"The placement of the Tacitean Aestii is based primarily on their association with amber, a popular luxury item during the life of Tacitus, with known sources at the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic amber trade, which appears to have extended to the Mediterranean Sea, has been traced by archaeologists back to the Nordic Bronze Age; its major center was in the region of Sambia."
PA,1305155-Aesti,"This trade probably existed before the historical Trojan War in the 13th century BCE, as amber is one of the substances in which the palace of Menelaus at Sparta was said to be rich in Homer's ""The Iliad""."
H1,1305155-Aesti,Cassiodorus
PA,1305155-Aesti,"Cassiodorus' ""Variae"", published in 537, contains a letter written by Cassiodorus in the name of Theodoric the Great, addressed to the Aesti:"
PA,1305155-Aesti,"The style of the letter proves that the nation was at that time independent, not ruled by the Ostrogoths. Apparently Cassiodorus considered it politically essential to establish friendly relations with the Nordic region. The letter also indicates that the Aesti were fully confident of the value of amber and had made out of it a trade secret. The sending of presents and the promise to show future favors were in ancient times a cordial way of giving ""de jure"" recognition to another power."
H1,1305155-Aesti,Jordanes
PA,1305155-Aesti,"Sixth Century historian Jordanes makes two references the Aesti in his book ""The Origins and the Deeds of the Goths"", which was a treatment of Cassiodorus' longer book (which no longer survives) on the history of the Goths. The first quote places the Aestii beyond the Vidivarii, on the shore of the Baltic: ""a subject race, likewise hold the shore of Ocean."" The next quote concerns the subjugation of the Aesti by Hermanaric, king of the Gothic Greuthungi: ""This ruler also subdued by his wisdom and might the race of the Aesti, who dwell on the farthest shore of the German Ocean""."
H1,1305155-Aesti,Alfred the Great
PA,1305155-Aesti,"In an 11th-century manuscript of King Alfred's account of the voyage from Hedeby to Truso by Wulfstan, held by the British Museum, includes ethnographic information on the medieval Aestii, in which the terms ""Esti"",""Est-mere"" and ""Eastland"" are used. In the text, a summary description of the country and its riches is followed by a very detailed account of the people's funeral customs."
LI,1305155-Aesti,Adam of Bremen
PA,1305155-Aesti,"During the 11th Century Adam of Bremen, citing Einhard (who in the ""Vita Caroli Magni"" states """"the Slavs and the Aisti live on the shores of the Eastern Sea""""), denotes the coastal tribe as the Haisti and refers to today's Estonia as Aestland."

Blatchford (1822–1886) and Agnes Leadbeater Blatchford (1824–1911), and his ancestors had come from Devonshire, England in the eighteenth century. His great-grandfather was Reverend Samuel Blatchford, his great-uncle was the New York attorney Richard Milford Blatchford, and the U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Blatchford was a cousin."
PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"He was educated at Williston Seminary in Massachusetts and Claverack College in New York, and graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with the class of 1882.

PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"He became a captain on April 26, 1898, during the first days of the Spanish–American War. Following two tours of duty in Puerto Rico, he served in the Philippines from 1901 to 1904, both in the field and in garrison, with the 28th, 11th, and 6th Regiments."
PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"After a brief tour as a recruiter in New York, Blatchford was an instructor and inspector for the Missouri National Guard. However, he had served with the 11th Infantry Regiment almost continuously while rising through the ranks, and in April 1913, he became a colonel and was given command of the regiment in Texas City, Texas."
PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"In 1914, Blatchford was assigned to command the 12th Infantry Regiment, then stationed in the San Francisco Presidio. Blatchford's regiment, a part of the Eighth Brigade under Brigadier General John J. Pershing, included 700 enlisted men and 30 commissioned officers. In April 1914, while on training maneuvers near Stanford University, Blatchford received orders for his regiment to travel with Pershing by rail to El Paso, Texas, where Pershing assembled the Eighth Brigade to guard the Mexican border. The regiment was later stationed at Nogales, Arizona, where Blatchford made arrangements for Pershing's peace conference on August 29, 1914 with Mexican generals Pancho Villa and Álvaro Obregón."
PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"While commanding the 12th, Blatchford organized a regimental school of musketry at the Presidio. By late 1915, Colonel Blatchford had been detailed as commandant of the Army's School of Musketry (today's Infantry School) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and held that position in April 1917 at the time of America's entry into World War I."

He sailed for France in July 1917, to observe trench warfare and Allied training methods, and on July 25, he was appointed commanding general of the Line of Communications, part of the American Expeditionary Forces. On August 5, 1917, he received a promotion to major general of the National Army. Blatchford failed to organize a functioning line of communication in France, resulting in inadequate transport of supplies to U.S. troops. Unhappy with his performance, Pershing decided to replace Blatchford with Francis Kernan. After being relieved of his command in Paris, Blatchford took charge of billeting at Neufchâteau. According to General Johnson Hagood, this job ""certainly did not warrant a special headquarters with a major general in command,"" but Blatchford maintained a large staff for allocating billets and office space, including a colonel in charge of constructing new buildings."
PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"In November 1917, Pershing sent Blatchford back to America, due to lack of competence. To spare his feelings and reputation, Pershing told him that he was needed to train a combat unit and then lead it to France to take part in the fighting. Blatchford later viewed the removal as a stain on his career, and he pursued the matter with Pershing after the war. In response, Pershing wrote that Blatchford's performance had in fact been unsatisfactory, and that their ""lifelong friendship"" had caused Pershing to refrain from telling him so at the time."
PA,14406219-Richard-M--Blatchford,"Despite being replaced as head of the Line of Communications, Blatchford's career flourished after his return from France. He briefly commanded the 158th Depot Brigade at Camp Sherman, Ohio (1917–1918), before taking command of the Panama Canal Department in 1918. He remained in command at the Panama Canal Zone through 1919, continuing after the end of the war. He later commanded the Presidio of San Francisco (1920–1921), 8th Infantry Brigade and Camp Lewis (1921), and 5th Infantry Brigade and Vancouver Barracks (1921–1922)."

PA,11988531-Copper-vapor-laser,"Copper vapor laser (CVL) uses vapors of copper as the lasing medium in a 3-level laser. It produces green laser light at 510.6 nm and yellow laser light at 578.2 nm. The pulse width is typically from 5 to 60 ns, and peak power from 50 to 5000 kW. Its pulse repetition frequencies can be 2 to 100 kHz. The ""average power"" of CVLs can range from 25 W to more than 2 kW."
PA,11988531-Copper-vapor-laser,It is one of the lasers that can be home built.
PA,11988531-Copper-vapor-laser,"Lasers using pure metal vapor produced from an elemental copper source are difficult to construct because of the extremely high temperature, about 1500 degrees C, necessary to create such vapor, severely limiting the materials for the vapor containment vessel and mirrors. Copper halides, specifically copper chloride, copper bromide and copper iodide, have been substituted since they form vapors at much lower temperatures, in the range 300-600 degrees C, but operation at such temperatures remains difficult. Copper compound vapors also increase the complexity of the pump signal applied to the device. Typically, two energizing pulses in quick succession are required, the first to dissociate vapor molecules, and the second to cause the dissociated ions to lase. Operating temperature can be further reduced by the use of copper nitrate or copper acetylacetonate, whose vapors give peak laser output power at 180 and 40 degrees C, respectively."
PA,11988531-Copper-vapor-laser,"Using singly ionized species of Cu, research has also demonstrated copper vapor lasers that are CW (continuous-wave), i.e., not pulsed, and lase at deep ultraviolet wavelengths. These lasers can provide average UV powers of several mW and are potentially useful for analytical instruments and spectroscopy."
PA,11988531-Copper-vapor-laser,"Copper vapor lasers are used in some machining and laser cutting applications. They can also be used in AVLIS isotope separation systems. In the AVLIS application the copper laser is used to excite tunable dye lasers. A review on copper-laser-pumped dye lasers is given by Webb in ""High Power Dye Lasers""."

PA,14454762-Optare-Olympus,"The Olympus was launched by East Lancashire Coachbuilders in November 2006. The first example, built on a Volvo B9TL chassis for Delaine Buses, was displayed at Euro Bus Expo 2006. It had been the intention to exhibit a higher specification model for Ham's of Flimwell, but this was not ready in time for the show, meaning the bus didn't show its full potential."

LI,1137816-Kyū,By Mauricio Camacho
LI,1137816-Kyū,"Lewis, Wood and Rodriguez, 0889 Brittany Squares Suite 458, North Thomas, ND 71476"
H1,1137816-Kyū,History
PA,1137816-Kyū,The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department started a ranking system using Kyū to measure the police officers' ability in Kendo. Grades were from 8th to 1st.
PA,1137816-Kyū,"In the 1890s, the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society introduced the ""dan"" and ""kyū"" ranking system to various martial arts in Japan."
H1,1137816-Kyū,Martial arts usage
PA,1137816-Kyū,"In modern Japanese martial arts, ""kyū""-level practitioners hold the ranks below ""dan"" or black belt. The ""kyū"" ranking system varies from art to art and school to school. In some arts, all the ""kyū""-level practitioners wear white belts while in others different coloured belts, tags or stripes are used; in ""kendo"" for example the belt system is not used. Although some aikido schools do use a coloured belt system the norm is for ""kyū"" grades to wear a white belt, and for ""dan"" grades to wear a black belt."
PA,1137816-Kyū,"""Kyū""-level practitioners are often called , ""ones without ""dan"""" and are considered as initiates rather than students. When practitioners have reached the ranking of first degree black belt, they become . The holder of a black belt of any degree is a , ""one with ""dan""""."
H1,1137816-Kyū,Academic tests usage
PA,1137816-Kyū,"Martial arts' organizations are not the only ones who use such a system. Some academic and professional organizations also use ""kyū"" and ""dan"" as measures of a person's ability. For instance, the Japan Kanji Aptitude Test which tests a person's ability to correctly read, write, and use kanji, is graded using ""kyū""."
LI,1137816-Kyū,List of Kyū ranks
PA,1137816-Kyū,"Some martial arts refer to the ""kyū"" ranks entirely in Japanese. ""Kyū"" ranks progress using a descending order system, so 1st ""kyū"" is the highest. For example, the first ""kyū"" outranks the 2nd ""kyū"". The ""Dan"" ranking system starts after 1st ""kyū"". Essentially, the ""kyū"" is the number of steps before reaching mastery whereas the ""dan"" gives steps ""into"" mastery."
PA,1137816-Kyū,"Pre-1st ""kyū"" and pre-2nd ""kyū"" are used in examinations of languages, because it is often hard to pass the examinations at 1st and 2nd ""kyū""."
PA,1137816-Kyū,"The lowest ""kyū"" is sometimes called ""Mukyū"" () which means ""ungraded"" in English. The lowest ""kyū"" depends on organizations. For instance, the United States Judo Federation has 12th ""kyū"" as the lowest grade for junior class, and 7th ""kyū"" as the lowest for adult class."
PA,1137816-Kyū,"In Japan, the difficulty is classified into three categories as in the following list."
H1,1137816-Kyū,Kyū ranks in China
PA,1137816-Kyū,"The Kyū grading system is used in China as well. Kyū () in China is called """"ji"""" (same character, different pronunciation), and descending order is used as in Japan."
H1,1137816-Kyū,Coloured belts
PA,1137816-Kyū,"In some styles, students wear white belts until they receive their first ""dan"" rank or black belt, while in others a range of colors are used for different ""kyū"" grades. The wearing of coloured belts is often associated with ""kyū"" ranks, particularly in modern martial arts such as karate and judo (where the practice originated). However, there is no standard association of belt colours with particular ranks and different schools and organizations assign colours independently; see Rank in Judo for examples of variation within an art. However, white is often the lowest ranked belt and brown is the highest ""kyū"" rank, and it is common to see the darker colors associated with the higher ranks, i.e., the closest to black belt."
PA,1137816-Kyū,"The system of using different colored belts to mark rank is not universally accepted in the martial arts. Supporters of the belt colors point out their use as a simple visual key for experience, such as in matching opponents for sparring, allowing opponents to somewhat accurately judge each other's skill, and to split them for competitions."
PA,1137816-Kyū,"Those who oppose the use of coloured belts are also often concerned that students will worry too much about relative rank, and become arrogant with trivial promotions and differences, while supporters feel that by providing small signs of success and recognition, students are more confident, and their training is more structured, and that the ranking system encourages higher-ranked students to assist lower-ranked ones, and lower-ranked students to respect their seniors."

PA,12287879-Hillaryland,"Hillaryland was the self-designated name of a group of core advisors to Hillary Clinton, when she was First Lady of the United States and again when, as United States Senator, she was one of the Democratic Party candidates for President in the 2008 U.S. election."
PA,12287879-Hillaryland,"The group included Huma Abedin, Patti Solis Doyle (credited with coining the name ""Hillaryland""), Mandy Grunwald, Neel Lattimore, Ann Lewis, Evelyn Lieberman, Tamera Luzzatto, Capricia Marshall, Cheryl Mills, Minyon Moore, Lissa Muscatine, Neera Tanden, Melanne Verveer, Lisa Caputo, Ann Stock and Maggie Williams. In her autobiography, ""Living History,"" Clinton credits campaign aide Steve Rabinowitz with first using the term."
PA,12287879-Hillaryland,"The group was distinguished in two prominent ways: First, almost all are women; the only man in the group, former First Lady deputy press secretary Neel Lattimore, is gay. Second, most worked in the Clinton Administration, and have been personal friends and confidants of Hillary Clinton since at least then, if not earlier. The name Hillaryland dates back to the Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, when it was the portion of his Little Rock, Arkansas ""war room"" that housed Hillary Clinton's staff. Later it became better known as the moniker for the area of the West Wing of the White House in which the First Lady's staff had their offices; according to Clinton, Hillaryland had its own subculture, based on camaraderie, never leaking information to the press, and having plenty of toys and cookies around for the children of staffers – as Hillary put it, ""While the West Wing had a tendency to leak... Hillaryland never did, and every child who ever visited knew exactly where we stashed the cookies."" Clinton biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, Jr. described Hillaryland as ""an important subculture during the Clinton presidency."""
PA,12287879-Hillaryland,"The advisers were also present during Clinton's tenure as U.S. Senator. But the role of Hillaryland came under considerable discussion during and after Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign that she conducted while senator. Michelle Cottle of ""New York"" magazine described its role as ""less a campaign entity than an extended sisterhood defined by its devotion to its namesake. Even so, the group's protective ethos dominates her presidential campaign, where loyalty is demanded, self-promotion frowned upon, and talking out of school, especially to the press, [is strongly discouraged]."" As campaign chroniclers John Heilemann and Mark Halperin later wrote, ""the people comprising it ... were loyal to a fault, smart and ruthless, hard-headed and hardboiled. ... They referred to themselves collectively as Hillaryland, and everyone else in politics did too."" By this point the definition of Hillaryland was often expanded a bit to include campaign insiders such as chief strategist Mark Penn."
PA,12287879-Hillaryland,"After she ended up losing the 2008 Democratic nomination, critics often focused on the limited and isolated circle of advisers and dysfunctional management style as one of the reasons behind the campaign's failure. One criticism was that she valued personal loyalty over the ability to do the job. The level of protection and the consequent inability to criticize failed tactics--and the public perception that Clinton needed that much protection--alarmed critics in 2015 as well, prior to her loss in the general election the following year."
PA,12287879-Hillaryland,"At the beginning of Clinton's 2009-13 tenure as U.S. Secretary of State, she brought over some of the Hillaryland personnel to staff the State Department, but she also hired other people as well."

H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Summary
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a scientific discipline concerned with applying techniques based upon the principles of learning to change behavior of social significance. It is the applied form of behavior analysis; the other two forms are radical behaviorism (or the philosophy of the science) and the experimental analysis of behavior (or basic experimental research).
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The name ""applied behavior analysis"" has replaced behavior modification because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior-environment interactions. In contrast, ABA tries to change behavior by first assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment. Further, the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives for aberrant behaviors."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"ABA has been brought to bear on a wide range of areas and behavioral problems. Examples include such things as early intensive behavioral interventions for children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), research on the principles influencing criminal behavior, as well as HIV prevention, conservation of natural resources, education, gerontology, health and exercise, industrial safety, language acquisition, littering, medical procedures, parenting, psychotherapy, seatbelt use, severe mental disorders, sports, substance abuse, phobias, pediatric feeding disorders, and zoo management and care of animals."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Definition
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"ABA is an applied science devoted to developing procedures which will produce observable changes in behavior. It is to be distinguished from the experimental analysis of behavior, which focuses on basic experimental research, but it uses principles developed by such research, in particular operant conditioning and classical conditioning. Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of radical behaviorism, treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of behavior modification."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Behavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a ""natural"" science as opposed to a ""social"" science. As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including antecedents and consequences, without resort to ""hypothetical constructs""."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,History
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The beginnings of ABA can be traced back to Teodoro Ayllon and Jack Michael's study ""The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer"" (1959) that they submitted to the ""Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior"" (JEAB) as part of their doctoral dissertation at the University of Houston. Ayllon and Michael were training the staff and nurses at a psychiatric hospital how to use a token economy based on the principles of operant conditioning and behavioral engineering—a synonym for ABA,"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"also then called behavior modification—with their patients, who were mostly adults with schizophrenia, but some were also mentally retarded children. This paper later served as the basis for the founding of the ""Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis"" (JABA), which publishes research on the application of behavior analysis to a wide array of socially relevant behavior."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A group of faculty and researchers at the University of Washington, including Donald Baer, Sidney W. Bijou, Bill Hopkins, Jay Birnbrauer, Todd Risley, and Montrose Wolf, applied the principles of behavior analysis to instruct developmentally disabled children, manage the behavior of children and adolescents in juvenile detention centers, and organize employees who required proper structure and management in businesses, among other situations. In 1968, Baer, Bijou, Risley, Birnbrauer, Wolf, and James Sherman joined the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas, where they founded the ""Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis""."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Notable graduate students from the University of Washington include Robert Wahler, James Sherman, and Ivar Lovaas. Lovaas established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles, and devoted nearly half a century to groundbreaking research and practice aimed at improving the lives of children with autism and their families. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior, and relied upon the methods of errorless learning that was initially devised by Charles Ferster to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In 1987, Lovaas published the landmark study, ""Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children"". The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless discrete trial training (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles are used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, ""Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment"". Lovaas’ work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The ""Lovaas Method"" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In addition to being a major contributor of ABA, Lovaas taught now prominent behaviorists, such as Robert Koegel, Laura Schreibman, Tristram Smith, John McEachin, Ron Leaf, Doreen Granpeesheh, Jacquie Wynn, and thousands of UCLA students who took his ""Behavior Modification"" course during his 50 years of teaching. He also co-founded what is today the Autism Society of America (ASA), published hundreds of research articles and books, received state and national awards, and forced school districts to adopt evidence-based teaching programs. His work influenced how autism is treated, and improved the lives of families and children diagnosed with autism worldwide."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Over the years, ""behavior analysis"" gradually superseded ""behavior modification""; that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior. This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"While ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used in a broad range of other situations. Recent notable areas of research in JABA include autism, classroom instruction with typically developing students, pediatric feeding therapy, and substance-use disorders. Other applications of ABA include applied animal behavior, behavioral economics, behavioral medicine, behavioral neuroscience, clinical behavior analysis, forensic behavior analysis, increasing job safety and performance, schoolwide positive behavior support, and systematic desensitization for phobias."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Characteristics
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Baer, Wolf, and Risley's 1968 article is still used as the standard description of ABA. It lists the following the seven characteristics of ABA."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Applied: ABA focuses on the social significance of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Behavioral: ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Analytic: Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation. Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations. The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Technological: The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately. Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Conceptually Systematic: Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions. Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as ""secondary reinforcement"" or ""errorless discrimination"" where appropriate."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Effective: Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Generality: Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Other proposed characteristics
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Accountable: To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Public: The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Doable: To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Empowering: ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Optimistic: According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Concepts
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Behavior
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Behavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment. Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ""response"" is a single instance of that behavior. If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. ""Repertoire"" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Operant conditioning
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Operant behavior is the so-called ""voluntary"" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the three-term contingency that uses stimulus control, in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as reinforcement or punishment. The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Respondent (classical) conditioning
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Respondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ""produce"" a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ""because"" it salivates)."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Environment
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists. This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included. A stimulus is an ""energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells""."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,A stimulus can be described:
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Topographically by its physical features.
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Temporally by when it occurs.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functionally by its effect on behavior.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Reinforcement
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Reinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning and in most behavior change programs. It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Punishment
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Punishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added (positive punishment) or removed (negative punishment). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out'). Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects. Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Extinction
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Extinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior. The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction. Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of shaping procedures."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Discriminated operant and three-term contingency
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S–R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts. This antecedent–behavior–consequence contingency is termed the three-term contingency. A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of stimulus control. More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as ""Setting Event"", ""Establishing Operations"", and ""Motivating Operations"" by various researchers in their publications."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Verbal behavior
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,B.F. Skinner's classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders. Skinner's system includes:
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Tact (psychology) – a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Mand (psychology) – behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Intraverbals – verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question)."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Autoclitic – secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of ""I think..."" vs. ""I know..."")"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,For assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Measuring behavior
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"When measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Repeatability
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Response classes occur repeatedly throughout time—i.e., how many times the behavior occurs."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Count is the number of occurrences in behavior.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Rate/frequency is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Celeration is the measure of how the rate changes over time.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Temporal extent
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"This dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time—i.e., how long the behavior occurs."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Duration is the amount of time in which the behavior occurs.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Temporal locus
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Each instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time—i.e., when the behavior occurs."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Response latency is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Interresponse time is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Derivative measures
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Derivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Percentage is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Trials-to-criterion are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Analyzing behavior change
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Experimental control
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:"
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,At least one participant
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,At least one behavior (dependent variable)
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,At least one setting
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,At least one treatment or intervention condition
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functional analysis (psychology)
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,History of functional analysis
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Prior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ""pre-assume"" consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, B.F. Skinner) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In 1977, Edward Carr published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) negative reinforcement in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In 1982, Iwata and colleagues conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functional behavior assessment (FBA)
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functions of behavior
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Behavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something. When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, ""What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?"" Described below are the common functions of behavior."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Obtain socially mediated events
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"""Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)"":"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in mom's attention. (If this behavior results in mom looking at child and giving him lots of attention—even if she's saying ""NO""—he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"""Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)"":"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits mom because s/he wants the toy mom is holding. (If this behavior results in mom giving the child the toy, s/he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"""Automatic positive reinforcement"":"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits his/her eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement)
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Escape/avoid socially mediated events
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"""Escape/removal of attention"":"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"""Escape/removal of tasks or activities"":"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Escape/avoid specific stimulation
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"""Automatic negative reinforcement"":"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs his head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Function versus topography
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"As previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Method of identifying functions of behavior
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,FBA methods can be classified into three types:
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Indirect assessment
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Descriptive assessment
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functional (experimental) analysis
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Indirect FBA
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"This method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as ""indirect"" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Descriptive FBA
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Unlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Another form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Functional (experimental) analysis
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Below, common examples of experimental conditions are described."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,A standard functional analysis normally has four conditions (three test conditions and one control).
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Attention
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In this condition, the experimenter gives the individual moderately preferred items and instructs them to go play. After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Escape
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Alone
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Control (play)
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Conducting a functional behavior assessment
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Functional behavior assessments are rarely limited to only one of the methods described above. The most common, and most preferred, method for identifying the function of behavior can be seen as a four-part processes."

LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Technologies developed through ABA research
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Task analysis
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Task analysis is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: forward chaining, backward chaining and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals). Behavioral scripts often emerge from a task analysis. Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills. A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors. Ivey would later call this ""behaviorist"" phase a very productive one and the skills-based approach came to dominate counselor training during 1970–90. Task analysis was also used in determining the skills needed to access a career. In education, Englemann (1968) used task analysis as part of the methods to design the Direct Instruction curriculum."
TI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Chaining
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The skill to be learned is broken down into small units for easy learning. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning to unscrew the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"For problem behavior, chains can also be analyzed and the chain can be disrupted to prevent the problem behavior. Some behavior therapies, such as dialectical behavior therapy, make extensive use of behavior chain analysis, but is not philosophically behavior analytic."
H2,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Prompting
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A prompt is a cue that is used to encourage a desired response from an individual. Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest prompt to fade (e.g.,verbal). In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically. During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Types of prompts
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Prompters might use any or all of the following to suggest the desired response:
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Vocal prompts: Words or other vocalizations
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Visual prompts: A visual cue or picture
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Gestural prompts: A physical gesture
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Positional prompt: e.g., the target item is placed close to the individual."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Modeling: Modeling the desired response. This type of prompt is best suited for individuals who learn through imitation and can attend to a model.
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Physical prompts: Physically manipulating the individual to produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places a hand on the learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap)."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"This is not an exhaustive list of prompts; the nature, number, and order of prompts are chosen to be the most effective for a particular individual."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Fading
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"The overall goal is for an individual to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt. This ensures that the individual does not become overly dependent on a particular prompt when learning a new behavior or skill."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Thinning a reinforcement schedule
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Thinning is often confused with fading. Fading refers to a prompt being removed, where thinning refers to an increase in the time or number of responses required between reinforcements. Periodic thinning that produces a 30% decrease in reinforcement has been suggested as an efficient way to thin. Schedule thinning is often an important and neglected issue in contingency management and token economy systems, especially when these are developed by unqualified practitioners (see professional practice of behavior analysis)."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Extinction
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Generalization
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Generalization is the expansion of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill. Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then ""generalize"" the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Shaping
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Shaping involves gradually modifying the existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then he or she could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"One teaching technique found to be effective with some students, particularly children, is the use of video modeling (the use of taped sequences as exemplars of behavior). It can be used by therapists to assist in the acquisition of both verbal and motor responses, in some cases for long chains of behavior."
LI,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Interventions based on an FBA
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Critical to behavior analytic interventions is the concept of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies."

H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Efficacy in autism
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"ABA-based techniques are often used to change behaviors associated with autism, so much so that ABA itself is often mistakenly considered to be synonymous with therapy for autism. ABA for autism may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ. The most influential and widely cited review of the literature regarding efficacy of treatments for autism is the National Research Council's book ""Educating Children with Autism"" (2001) which concluded that ABA was the best research supported and most effective treatment for the main characteristics of autism. Some critics claimed that the NRC's report was an inside job by behavior analysts but there were no board certified behavior analysts on the panel (which did include physicians, speech pathologists, educators, psychologists, and others). Other criticisms raised include the small sample sizes used in the published research to date. Medications have not been proven to correct the core deficits of ASDs and are not the primary treatment. ABA is the primary treatment according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Recent reviews of the efficacy of ABA-based techniques in autism include:"
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A 2007 clinical report of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the benefit of ABA-based interventions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) ""has been well documented"" and that ""children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior""."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Researchers from the MIND Institute published an evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008. On the basis of ""the strength of the findings from the four best-designed, controlled studies"", they were of the opinion that one ABA-based approach (the Lovaas technique created by Ole Ivar Løvaas) is ""well-established"" for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A 2009 review of psycho-educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high-quality (""Level 1"" or ""Level 2"") studies assessed ABA-based treatments. On the basis of these and other studies, the author concluded that ABA is ""well-established"" and is ""demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists"". However, the review committee also concluded that ""there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective""."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis, an effect size analysis, and a meta-analysis of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI, a form of ABA-based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique) for autism. It determined that EIBI's effect sizes were ""generally positive"" for IQ, adaptive behavior, expressive language, and receptive language. The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other ""empirically validated treatment programs""."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In a 2009 systematic review of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007, the researchers wrote ""there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some, but not all, children with autism spectrum disorders, and there is wide variability in response to treatment"". Furthermore, any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a ""large"" effect on full-scale intelligence and a ""moderate"" effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"In 2011, investigators from Vanderbilt University under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the UCLA/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and Geraldine Dawson). They concluded that ""both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills"". However, they also concluded that ""the strength of evidence ... is low"", ""many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment"", ""subgroups may account for a majority of the change"", there is ""little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies"", and the published studies ""used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements""."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving a total of 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews. Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior. In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI. Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI. Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site randomized trials are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism. Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A United States District Court Judge ruled withholding ABA from children (0–21) with autism causes irreparable harm, finding Elizabeth Dudek of Florida's Agency for Healthcare Administration's position suggesting ABA was experimental was arbitrary and capricious, ordering AHCA enjoined from withholding ABA. Thereafter, CMS ordered its guidance that all states to cover ABA via Head Start and Early Head Start EPSDT programs."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Further research is clearly required, specifically to include larger and thus more representative samples."
H1,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,Criticism
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. Various major figures within the autistic community have written biographies detailing harm caused by the provision of ABA. Several of these people have since been diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Less scholarly reviews were provided by Elizabeth Devita-Raeburn in ""The Atlantic"" magazine and by an ex-practitioner."
PA,1781075-Applied-behavior-analysis,"A 2018 study, based on a survey of 'post-traumatic stress symptoms' completed by individuals with presumed, self-reported diagnosis of ASD and their caregivers, found that 46% of the individuals who also reported receiving ABA treatment met the author's ""diagnostic threshold for PTSD"" via their survey score, versus 28% of respondents not reporting receipt of ABA treatment. Individuals reported as receiving ABA were 86% more likely on average (41% for adults, 130% for children) to meet the author's ""diagnostic threshold"". However, in the same journal and same year, the study was heavily criticized by peer reviewers who used objective evaluation to note the study's multiple critical methodological and conceptual flaws. These significant issues included hypothesis-testing bias, non-validated diagnoses of ASD and measures of 'post-traumatic stress symptoms', and indirect survey-based measures with leading questions, correlation-based conclusions, incomplete treatment descriptions, and unverified self-report with tendencies for response bias and unreliable 'say-do' correspondence. These authors expressed caution to families and consumers who could be misled into falsely believing that ""an intervention with vast amounts of empirical support is harmful rather than effective...[due to a] biased analysis which led to striking claims with little to no evidence to support these claims."""

PA,15363618-Diego-Hidalgo-y-Durán,"Born in Los Santos de Maimona (Extremadura) in a family of aristocratic descent, Diego Hidalgo had to make a living early as his family had no lands and his father died when he was young. After studying law, he passed the state exam to become a notary, and started supporting his mother and four siblings."
PA,15363618-Diego-Hidalgo-y-Durán,"Hidalgo was a Republican (even though he had rights to two titles of Marquis, given up by his grandfather, Diego Hidalgo y Solís). One of the drafters of the Constitutions of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, and a member of the Radical Republican Party presided by Alejandro Lerroux, Hidalgo became Minister of War in 1934. When serving as Minister, Hidalgo chose Francisco Franco (who was later going to be lead nationalist Spain during the civil war and be the caudillo for nearly 40 years) as one of his advisers. Hidalgo ordered Franco to stop the asturian miners' strike of 1934. Although Franco would later reveal to different ideologically from Hidalgo, he kept affection for him, and Hidalgo was one of the only people who could speak freely with Franco."
PA,15363618-Diego-Hidalgo-y-Durán,"During the Spanish civil war (1936–1939), Diego Hidalgo had to flee from Spain, where he was threatened both by Nationalists and Republicans. He spent most of the war in France where he married Gerda Schnur, the daughter of German industrialist David Schnur."
PA,15363618-Diego-Hidalgo-y-Durán,"Back in Spain in 1938, Hidalgo continued his activities as a lawyer, notary, and writer. Notably, he saved 39 Republican political prisoners from being executed, proving their innocence. Hidalgo was also a member of the International Court of Justice."

In 1983, the station changed its callsign to KELA-FM, but only held this callsign for less than a month before the calls changed to KMNT. During the 1990s, KMNT was branded as ""The Mountain"", and served the Centralia/Chehalis area. In 2004, their tower moved to Capitol Peak near Olympia, the station shifted their focus to the South Sound, adopted a new call sign of KNBQ and a new branding: ""Q Country 102.9"". Its studios were moved to Tacoma as well."

The first (and ultimately last) song on ""ALT"" was ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana. The move was part of a format shuffle on four of iHeart's Seattle stations, with KBKS's Mainstream Top 40 format moving to 93.3 FM, displacing KUBE's longtime Rhythmic Top 40 format, which would move to KKBW. KKBW's active rock format would be modified to alternative and move to KYNW. On February 5, 2016, KYNW changed its call letters to KFOO, referencing the Seattle-based band Foo Fighters."

H1,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,Epistemic theory of miracles
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"The epistemic theory of miracles is the name given by the philosopher William Vallicella to the theory of miraculous events given by St. Augustine and Baruch Spinoza. According to the theory, there are no events contrary to nature — that is no ""transgressions"", in Hume's sense, of the laws of nature. An event is a miracle only in the sense that it does not agree with our ""understanding"" of nature, or fit our picture of nature, or that it thwarts our expectations as to how the world should behave. According to a perfect scientific understanding there would be no miracles at all."
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"The name of the theory is derived from the Ancient Greek word , ""episteme"", meaning ""well-founded knowledge""."
H1,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,Augustine's account
LI,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"In The City of God, Book XXI, Chapter 8, Augustine quotes Marcus Varro, ""Of the Race of the Roman People"":"
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"Augustine argues that there can be no true transgression of the laws of nature, because everything that happens according to God's will happens by nature, and a transgression of the laws of nature would therefore happen contrary to God's will. A miracle therefore is not contrary to nature as it really is, but only contrary to nature as our current understanding supposes it to be (""Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura"")."
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"For example, if we were to see a man walking on water, and the man really were walking on water, that would not be possible given the laws of nature ""as we understand them"". (The surface tension of water is not great enough to support a man's weight.) But it is logically possible that our understanding of the laws of nature is incomplete, and that under certain circumstances it is possible for a man to walk on water."
H1,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,Spinoza's account
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"In Chapter Six of Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise (""Of Miracles""), Spinoza claims that the universal laws of nature are decrees of God. Hence, any event happening in nature which contravened nature's universal laws, would necessarily also contravene the Divine decree, nature, and understanding; or if anyone asserted that God acted in contravention to the laws of nature, he, ""ipso facto"", would be compelled to assert that God acted against His own nature—an evident absurdity."
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"In other words, according to Spinoza, miracles are not a transgression of natural or scientific laws, but only of natural laws as we currently understand them. A ""miracle"" is simply an event we cannot explain, and is parasitic upon our ignorance. It is, in reality, a natural event that surpasses our limited human comprehension. To a perfect understanding nothing would appear miraculous. This is the first main point that Spinoza makes in his chapter ""Of Miracles."""
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"His second point is that neither God's nature, nor his existence can be known from miracles; they can be known only from the fixed and immutable order of nature. If we understand miracles as actual interruptions or contraventions of the order of nature, and so of the will of God, then not only are they impossible, but they can provide no basis for knowledge of God. However, if understanding miracles ""epistemically"", i.e. as events the causes of which we do not understand, then we have no basis for knowledge of God in this case either. We cannot base knowledge of God on ignorance, and events are miraculous only due to our ignorance of their natural causes."
LI,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,John Polkinghorne
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"The view of particle physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne is somewhat similar. Polkinghorne argues that an apparently simple event like boiling water, where a small quantity of liquid changes into a large quantity of steam (a phase transition) would seem miraculous to someone who had not seen it every day."
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"Polkinghorne argues that God cannot control things on the macroscopic scale by acting microscopically on each elementary particle in the universe, but that He can act within the framework of chaos theory as ""pure spirit"". As the complex nonlinear systems of life oscillate back and forth trying to decide which strange attractor to move towards, God intervenes gently in the direction that moves the system where he wishes it to go. See Quantum mysticism."
TI,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,McLean v. Arkansas
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"The epistemic conception of the miraculous does not agree with the definition given in the famous McLean v. Arkansas case. In this case (""McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education"", 529 F. Supp. 1255, 1258–1264) (ED Ark. 1982), brought in Arkansas, the judge, William Overton, gave a clear, specific definition of science as a basis for ruling that 'creation science' is religion and not science. His judgment defined the essential characteristics of science as being"
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"However, an epistemic explanation of miraculous events would satisfy at least the first two definitions."
H1,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,Islamic view of miracles
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,"The epistemic conception of the miraculous does not agree with the definition given in the work of the Muslim scholar ""al-Īd̲j̲ī Mawāḳif"", historian A.J. Wensinck, who says that the main purpose of miracle is to prove the sincerity of the apostle and has to satisfy the following conditions:"
PA,19102078-Epistemic-theory-of-miracles,It must be performed by God

LI,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Godolphin Arabian
BY,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Tanya Ryan
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The Godolphin Arabian (–1753), also known as the Godolphin Barb, was an Arabian horse or Barb horse who was one of three stallions that founded the modern Thoroughbred (the others were the Darley Arabian and the Byerley Turk). He was named after his best-known owner, Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin."
H1,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Origins
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The Godolphin Arabian was foaled about 1724 in Yemen and moved several times before reaching England. At some early age he was exported, probably via Syria, to the stud of the Bey of Tunis. From there he was given to Louis XV of France in 1730. It is believed he was a present from monarch to monarch. Even so, he was not valued by his new French owner, and it is believed he was used as a carthorse."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The horse was then imported from France by Edward Coke and sent to his stud at Longford Hall, Derbyshire where he remained until the death of his owner in 1733."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"He was bequeathed to Roger Williams, ""proprietor of the St. James's Coffee House"", who inherited Coke's stallions. He was bought by the 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and placed at his stud at Babraham, Cambridgeshire, until his death on Christmas Day 1753."
H1,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Appearance
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,The Godolphin Arabian was a bay colour with some white on the off heel behind. He stood at and was distinguished by an unnaturally high crest which is noticeable from portraits of the horse. Most of his immediate offspring were also bay.
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,The veterinary surgeon Osmer described the Godolphin Arabian in the following manner:
H1,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Breed controversy
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"Controversy exists over the ancestry of this horse; some writers referred to him as a Barb, but Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud concludes that it is most widely believed that he was an Arabian or had primarily Arabian lineage."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"""Barb"" is a reference to his believed country of origin, Tunisia, on the Barbary Coast. Whyte in the 1840 ""History of the British Turf"", refers to the horse as ""The Godolphin Barb, or ""as he has been improperly called"", the Godolphin Arabian"" (emphasis added) before further clarifying, ""he was long considered an Arabian, although his points resembled more those of the highest breed of Barbs."" However, portraits showing a horse with a high-carried tail and dished profile, features that differentiate the two types, lead modern experts to believe he was more likely an Arabian. The confusion is understandable, but while the breeds have some characteristics in common and are distantly related, their phenotypes are quite distinct. There was also an argument raised that he was actually a Turkomen, merely called an Arabian in order to raise the stud fee."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The Earl of Godolphin referred to the horse as an Arabian, and he was described as such by the painter George Stubbs. Lord Godolphin later bought a second stallion in 1750. This one he clearly called a ""barb"". Both were of a similar bay colour but the Barb had a star. Godolphin later bought a grey Barb, which has also caused some confusion over the years."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"Recent DNA studies disprove the theory that he was a Barb, as his descendants' Y-DNA traces to the same general haplotype as the Darley Arabian, though to different sub-groups and there are relatively few male-line descendants of the Goldophin Arabian today. This group may have been of Turkoman horse or Arabian origins, as modern horses of both breeds have been linked to this haplotype."
H1,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Breeding career
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The Godolphin Arabian was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1738, 1745 and 1747."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"Originally, this small stallion was considered inferior to the larger European horses of the time and was not meant to be put to stud. Instead he was used as 'teaser', a stallion used to gauge the mare's receptiveness. This changed when Lady Roxana, a mare brought to the stud specifically to be bred to a stallion called Hobgoblin, rejected her intended mate, and so the Godolphin Arabian was allowed to cover her instead."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The result of this mating was Lath, the first of his offspring, who went on to win the Queen's Plate nine times out of nine at the Newmarket races. The second colt from this pair was Cade, and the third was Regulus. All three were the same gold-touched bay as their sire, with the same small build and high crested conformation. All were exceptionally fast on the track, and went on to sire many foals themselves. This was the start of the Godolphin Arabian's prowess as a racing stud, and he spent the rest of his days as the Earl of Godolphin's prize stallion, bred to England's finest mares."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The American connection began with the filly Selima (born in 1745 out of Shireborn). She was purchased by Benjamin Tasker Jr. of the Province of Maryland in Colonial America, carried to the new world, and raced between 1750 and 1753. She won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 pistoles at Gloucester, Virginia which marked ""the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and Virginia."" After this, she became a successful broodmare at the Belair Stud in Collington, Maryland."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The major Thoroughbred sire Eclipse traces in his sire line to the Darley Arabian, but his dam was a daughter of Regulus and thus also traces to the Godolphin Arabian. This pattern continues to be seen today, with the Godolphin Arabian more heavily represented in dam lines and in the ""middle"" of pedigrees as opposed to direct sire lines."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"The Godolphin Arabian died on the Gog Magog hills Cambridgeshire in 1753, aged around 29. The horse's grave in the stable block of Wandlebury House can be visited. When he was interred, the occasion was marked with ale and cake."
H1,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,Legacy
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"Although today the majority of Thoroughbred horses’ sire lines trace to the Darley Arabian, many famous North American horses of the past trace their sire line back to the Godolphin Arabian. These include Seabiscuit, Man o' War, War Admiral, and Silky Sullivan. Today, the sire line is primarily supported by descendants of Relaunch and his son Cee's Tizzy through dual Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"In Europe, his influence survives mainly through the 2,000 Guineas winner Known Fact, and his son, the champion miler Warning. This line has produced outstanding sprinters such as Diktat (Haydock Sprint Cup), Avonbridge and Dream Ahead. The Derby has not been won by a sire line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian since Santa Claus in 1964 and is nowadays dominated by descendants of the Darley Arabian."
H1,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,In fiction
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"""King of the Wind"" (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1948) is a fictional biography of the Godolphin Arabian by American author Marguerite Henry. She wrote many books about horses for children, and perhaps is best known for ""Misty of Chincoteague"" and its sequels. She won the Newbery Medal for ""King of the Wind"", recognizing it as the year's ""most distinguished contribution to American literature for children"". ""Misty"" became a film in 1961, but ""King of the Wind"" had to wait till 1990 for its adaptation, with Navin Chowdhry as the Arabian's lifetime stable boy Agba."
PA,161772-Godolphin-Arabian,"In the novel, the Godolphin Arabian was foaled in Morocco and was called Sham. He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King Louis XV of France but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of Holkham Hall, older brother of the 1st Earl of Leicester 5th Creation, then sold to Francis, Earl of Godolphin, who maintained a stud in Suffolk, near the racing town of Newmarket."

PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,", born April 25, 1947 as is a former sumo wrestler from Hokkaidō, Japan. His highest rank was ""ōzeki"". After his retirement he set up Ōshima stable which he ran from 1980 until he left the Japan Sumo Association in 2012 upon reaching the age of 65."
H1,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,Career
PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,"Born in Aibetsu, Kamikawa District, Asahikuni made his professional debut in July 1963, joining Tatsunami stable. He reached the second highest ""jūryō"" division in March 1969 and the top ""makuuchi"" division just two tournaments after that. In 1970 he dropped to ""jūryō"" once again but he returned to the top division in 1972, reaching ""sekiwake"" in November."
PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,"At the beginning of 1976 Asahikuni put together two strong records of 12–3 and 13-2, finishing as runner-up in both tournaments, and this earned him promotion to the rank of ""ōzeki"". It had taken him 77 tournaments from his professional debut to reach ""ōzeki"", which at the time was the slowest ever. His best tournament result came in July 1977 when he lost just one bout, but he finished as runner-up to Kitanoumi who won with a perfect record. Asahikuni was never able to win a top division championship, this being his fourth and final runner-up performance."
PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,"He retired in September 1979 after 21 tournaments as an ""ōzeki"". His retirement was enforced, as he had broken his shoulder in a bout with Mienoumi. The two wrestlers had been friends as well as rivals, having made their professional debuts in the same month, and their friendship survived the incident."
H1,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,Fighting style
PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,"Asahikuni was an extremely skilful wrestler, earning the nickname ""the PhD of sumo"", such was his knowledge of a wide variety of techniques. He won the prestigious ""Ginō-shō"", or Technique prize, on six occasions. He achieved this despite the fact that he suffered regularly from pancreatitis and was known even to commute to tournaments from hospital. He specialised in a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's ""mawashi"", ""migi-yotsu"", from which he regularly won by ""shitatenage"", or underarm throw. He was also one of very few wrestlers to use ""tottari"", or arm pull."
H1,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,Retirement from sumo
PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,"Asahikuni stayed in the sumo world as an elder under the name of Ōshima Oyakata. In 1980 he established Ōshima stable, despite strong opposition from his old stable boss Tatsunami. Ōshima stable produced Asahifuji, who reached the ""yokozuna"" rank in 1990, and in 1992 Ōshima became the first stablemaster to recruit Mongolians, with six joining for the March 1992 tournament. Two of them, Kyokushūzan and Kyokutenhō, reached the top division, rising to ""komusubi"" and ""sekiwake"" respectively. In all Ōshima produced ten ""sekitori"", including ""komusubi"" Kyokudozan and Asahiyutaka. He also worked as a judge of tournament bouts and was on the Japan Sumo Association's board of directors until 2010 when he lost an election to Takanohana. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 in April 2012 Ōshima stable was dissolved with its wrestlers moving to Tomozuna stable. Kyokutenhō, who had once been considered a future head of Ōshima stable, instead became head of Tomozuna stable in 2017."
H1,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,Family
PA,12363463-Asahikuni-Masuo,"Asahikuni has two sons, both of whom joined his stable, but neither reached the elite ""sekitori"" ranks. His eldest, Tomō, born in 1978, joined in 1994 and was known as Kyokuhoten. He retired in November 1999 after a long injury layoff, with a highest rank of ""sandanme"" 26. His younger son Kunihiro, born in 1979, made his debut in 1995 and fought under the similar ring name of Kyokushoten. He had a much longer and marginally more successful career, reaching a highest rank of ""makushita"" 46 before retiring in January 2011."

PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"The Watts Bar Nuclear Plant is a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) nuclear reactor pair used for electric power generation. It is located on a 1,770-acre (7.2 km²) site in Rhea County, Tennessee, near Spring City, between the cities of Chattanooga and Knoxville. Watts Bar supplies enough electricity for about 1,200,000 households in the Tennessee Valley."
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"The plant, construction of which began in 1973, has two Westinghouse pressurized water reactor units: Unit 1, completed in 1996, and Unit 2, completed in 2015. Unit 1 has a winter net dependable generating capacity of 1,167 megawatts. Unit 2 has a capacity of 1,165 megawatts. Both units are the newest operating civilian reactors to come online in the United States, and Unit 2 is the first and only new reactor to enter service in the 21st century."
LI,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,Unit 1
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"The construction began on 23 January 1973, and suffered from many delays. After construction was halted on both units in 1985, construction resumed on Unit 1 in 1992. First criticality was achieved on 1 January 1996 and commercial operation began on May 5th, 1996."
LI,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,Unit 2
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"Unit 2 was 80% complete when construction on both units was stopped in 1985 due in part to a projected decrease in power demand. In 2007, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board approved completion of Unit 2 on August 1, and construction resumed on October 15. The project was expected to cost $2.5 billion, and employ around 2,300 contractor workers. Once finished, it was expected to employ 250 people in permanent jobs. The final cost of the plant is estimated at $6.1 billion."
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"A year after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued 9 orders to improve safety at domestic plants. Two applied to Watts Bar Unit 2 and required design modifications: ""Mitigation Strategies Order"" and ""Spent Fuel Pool Instrumentation Order"". In February 2012, TVA said the design modifications to Watts Bar 2 were partially responsible for the project running over budget and behind schedule. The second unit cost a total of $4.7 billion bringing the total cost of the plant to more than $12 billion."
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"TVA declared construction substantially complete in August 2015 and requested that NRC staff proceed with the final licensing review; on October 22, the NRC approved a forty-year operating license for Unit 2, marking the formal end of construction and allowing for the installation of nuclear fuel and subsequent testing. On December 15, 2015, TVA announced that the reactor was fully loaded with fuel and ready for criticality and power ascension tests. In March 2016, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission described the project as a ""chilled work environment,"" where employees are reluctant to raise safety concerns for fear of retribution."
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"On May 23, 2016, initial criticality was achieved. , a transformer fire had delayed the start of commercial operation past the late summer goal. Commercial operation started in October 2016, once the affected transformer was replaced, operators completed the inspection on the switchyard affected equipment and the final full power testing was completed. On October 19, 2016 the Watts Bar 2 was the first United States reactor to enter commercial operation since 1996. Due to failures in its condenser, TVA took it offline on March 23, 2017; as of May 2017, the cause of the problem had not been determined. The condenser, which was installed during the original construction phase of the plant in the 1970s, suffered a structural failure in one of its sections. On August 1, 2017 the unit was restarted after four months of repairs to the condenser."

H1,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,Tritium production
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"The NRC operating license for Watts Bar was modified in September 2002 to allow TVA to irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods at Watts Bar to produce tritium for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Nuclear Security Administration. The Watts Bar license amendment currently permits TVA to irradiate up to approximately 2,000 tritium-producing rods in the Watts Bar reactor."
PA,1801033-Watts-Bar-Nuclear-Plant,"TVA began irradiating tritium-producing rods at Watts Bar Unit 1 in the fall of 2003. TVA removed these rods from the reactor in the spring of 2005. DOE successfully shipped them to its tritium-extraction facility at Savannah River Site in South Carolina. DOE reimburses TVA for the cost of providing the irradiation services, and also pays TVA a fee for each tritium-producing rod that is irradiated. As the tritium is used for military purposes, Watts Bar unit 1 is fuelled by uranium which does not have peaceful only use non-proliferation restrictions as is normal for commercial reactors."

The 2018 Southern Appalachian earthquake's epicenter was located two miles east of the facility. The TVA reported that their facilities are designed to withstand seismic events and were not impacted by the earthquake, but personnel would conduct further inspections as a precaution."

LI,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Nondimensionalization
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"Nondimensionalization is the partial or full removal of units from an equation involving physical quantities by a suitable substitution of variables. This technique can simplify and parameterize problems where measured units are involved. It is closely related to dimensional analysis. In some physical systems, the term scaling is used interchangeably with ""nondimensionalization"", in order to suggest that certain quantities are better measured relative to some appropriate unit. These units refer to quantities to the system, rather than units such as SI units. Nondimensionalization is not the same as converting extensive quantities in an equation to intensive quantities, since the latter procedure results in variables that still carry units."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"Nondimensionalization can also recover characteristic properties of a system. For example, if a system has an intrinsic resonance frequency, length, or time constant, nondimensionalization can recover these values. The technique is especially useful for systems that can be described by differential equations. One important use is in the analysis of control systems."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"One of the simplest characteristic units is the doubling time of a system experiencing exponential growth, or conversely the half-life of a system experiencing exponential decay; a more natural pair of characteristic units is mean age/mean lifetime, which correspond to base ""e"" rather than base 2."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Many illustrative examples of nondimensionalization originate from simplifying differential equations. This is because a large body of physical problems can be formulated in terms of differential equations. Consider the following:

LI,1683270-Nondimensionalization,List of partial differential equation topics
LI,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Differential equations of mathematical physics
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"Although nondimensionalization is well adapted for these problems, it is not restricted to them. An example of a non-differential-equation application is dimensional analysis; another example is normalization in statistics."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"Measuring devices are practical examples of nondimensionalization occurring in everyday life. Measuring devices are calibrated relative to some known unit. Subsequent measurements are made relative to this standard. Then, the absolute value of the measurement is recovered by scaling with respect to the standard."
H1,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Rationale
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"Suppose a pendulum is swinging with a particular period ""T"". For such a system, it is advantageous to perform calculations relating to the swinging relative to ""T"". In some sense, this is normalizing the measurement with respect to the period."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"Measurements made relative to an intrinsic property of a system will apply to other systems which also have the same intrinsic property. It also allows one to compare a common property of different implementations of the same system. Nondimensionalization determines in a systematic manner the characteristic units of a system to use, without relying heavily on prior knowledge of the system's intrinsic properties"
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"(one should not confuse characteristic units of a ""system"" with natural units of ""nature""). In fact, nondimensionalization can suggest the parameters which should be used for analyzing a system. However, it is necessary to start with an equation that describes the system appropriately."
H1,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Nondimensionalization steps
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"To nondimensionalize a system of equations, one must do the following:"
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Identify all the independent and dependent variables;
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Replace each of them with a quantity scaled relative to a characteristic unit of measure to be determined;
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Divide through by the coefficient of the highest order polynomial or derivative term;
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Choose judiciously the definition of the characteristic unit for each variable so that the coefficients of as many terms as possible become 1;
LI,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Rewrite the system of equations in terms of their new dimensionless quantities.
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"The last three steps are usually specific to the problem where nondimensionalization is applied. However, almost all systems require the first two steps to be performed."
H1,1683270-Nondimensionalization,Conventions
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"There are no restrictions on the variable names used to replace """"x"""" and """"t"""". However, they are generally chosen so that it is convenient and intuitive to use for the problem at hand. For example, if """"x"""" represented mass, the letter """"m"""" might be an appropriate symbol to represent the dimensionless mass quantity."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"In this article, the following conventions have been used:"
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"""t"" - represents the independent variable - usually a time quantity. Its nondimensionalized counterpart is formula_1."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"""x"" - represents the dependent variable - can be mass, voltage, or any measurable quantity. Its nondimensionalized counterpart is formula_2."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"A subscripted ""c"" added to a quantity's variable-name is used to denote the characteristic unit used to scale that quantity. For example, if ""x"" is a quantity, then ""x"" is the characteristic unit used to scale it."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"As an illustrative example, consider a first order differential equation with constant coefficients:"
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"In this equation the independent variable here is ""t"", and the dependent variable is ""x""."

PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"If the differential equation only contains real (not complex) coefficients, then the properties of such a system behaves as a mixture of first and second order systems only. This is because the roots of its characteristic polynomial are either real, or complex conjugate pairs. Therefore, understanding how nondimensionalization applies to first and second ordered systems allows the properties of higher order systems to be determined through superposition."
PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"The number of free parameters in a nondimensionalized form of a system increases with its order. For this reason, nondimensionalization is rarely used for higher order differential equations. The need for this procedure has also been reduced with the advent of symbolic computation."

PA,1683270-Nondimensionalization,"A variety of systems can be approximated as either first or second order systems. These include mechanical, electrical, fluidic, caloric, and torsional systems.

PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"Henry Mayo Newhall (May 13, 1825 – March 13, 1882) was an American businessman whose extensive land holdings became the Southern California communities of Newhall, Saugus and Valencia, and the city of Santa Clarita."
H1,10802476-Henry-Newhall,Life
PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"Born in Saugus, Massachusetts, Henry Newhall came to California, like many others, in search of gold during the California Gold Rush. He had been working as an auctioneer when news of the gold rush reached the East Coast. He left by ship, arriving on the West Coast in 1850. However, he had been forced to stop in the Isthmus of Panama for six months to recover from an illness he contracted. Upon his arrival in San Francisco, many of the good mining sites had already been claimed, so he opened an auction house instead. H.M. Newhall & Company became extremely successful."
PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"Newhall's next business interest was railroads. He invested in rail companies that would connect San Francisco to other cities and became president of the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road. In 1870, when he and his partners sold the company to Southern Pacific Railroad, he joined its board of directors."
PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"After railroads, Newhall turned his eye to auctioneering, real estate and ranching. He purchased of Mexican land grants, including Rancho Todos Santos y San Antonio, and Rancho Suey in Santa Barbara County, and Rancho El Piojo and Rancho San Miguelito de Trinidad in Monterey County."
PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"The most significant acquisition was the historic land grant Rancho San Francisco in the Santa Clarita Valley of northern Los Angeles County, which he purchased for $2/acre. It included portions of the Santa Clara River and the Santa Susana Mountains, the former homeland of the Tataviam Native Americans. The ranch became known as Newhall Ranch after Newhall's death. Within this territory, he granted a right-of-way to Southern Pacific Railroad through what is now Newhall Pass, and he also sold them a portion of the land, upon which the company built a town they named after him: Newhall. The first station built on the line he named for his hometown, Saugus."
PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"Newhall split his time between his ranch in the Santa Clarita Valley and his auction house and residence in San Francisco, but after a bout of food poisoning in 1880, he retired to his ranch. In March 1882, while horseback riding around his property, he was thrown from the horse. Taken back to San Francisco for treatment, he died a few days later on March 13, 1882."
PA,10802476-Henry-Newhall,"Henry Newhall's heirs incorporated the Newhall Land and Farming Company, which oversaw the latter 20th century development of urban sprawl in towns on its land as planned communities. Henry Mayo Newhall is memorialized by the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, several street names in the area once part of the Newhall Ranch (including the portion of California State Route 126 west of Interstate 5 known as Henry Mayo Drive), and the Henry Mayo Newhall Foundation."

PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"Joseph-Anne-Marie de Moyriac de Mailla (also Anna, and de Moyria) () (16 December 1669 – 28 June 1748) was a French Jesuit missionary to China."
H1,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,Biography
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"Mailla was born at Château Maillac on the Isère. After finishing his studies, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1686, and, in 1701, was sent on a mission to China as a member of the Jesuits. In June, 1703, Father Mailla arrived in Morocco and thence set out for Canton where he acquired a thorough knowledge of Chinese language and writing."
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"He devoted himself particularly to the study of Chinese historical works. When the Kangxi Emperor entrusted the Jesuit missionaries with the cartographical survey of his empire, the provinces of Henan, Zhejiang, and Fujian, and the Island of Formosa, fell to the lot of Mailla along with Jean-Baptiste Régis and Roman Hinderer. When the work had been completed, the emperor conferred on Father Mailla the rank of mandarin as a mark of his satisfaction."
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"When Father Mailla died, in his seventy-ninth year, in Beijing, China, he was buried at the expense of the Qianlong Emperor, many people being present at the obsequies."
H1,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,Works
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"When he was fifty years old he began the study of the Manchu language, and made such progress that he was able to translate into French the ""Thoung-kian-kang-mou"" (), Zhu Xi's extract from the great Chinese annals, which on the orders of the Kangxi Emperor had been translated into the Manchu language. He finished the translation in several volumes in the year 1730, and in 1737 sent it to France, where it lay for thirty years in the library of the college at Lyon, Fréret, who purposed publishing it, having died."
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"After the suppression of the Jesuit order, the college authorities gave the manuscript to the Abbé Grosier on condition that he would see to the publication of the work. Not long after, the work appeared under the title: ""Histoire générale de la Chine, ou Annales de cet Empire; traduit du Tong-kien-kang-mou par de Mailla, Paris, 1777-1783"", in 12 volumes, with maps and plans. In 1785 a thirteenth volume followed. Besides Grosier, the Orientalists Deshauterayes and Colson were mainly responsible for the publication."
H1,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,Translator
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"Mailla is also the first European scholar to whom we owe a detained knowledge of the ""Shujing"", the classic historical work of the Chinese, most of its books being included in his translation. Mailla, also, in order to promote the work of the mission, compiled some edifying books in Chinese; the most important being lives of the saints, and meditations on the Gospels of the Sundays throughout the whole year."
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"In ""Lettres édifiantes"" there are some letters from him on the persecution of the Christians which took place in China during his time."
H1,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,Significance
PA,17634685-Joseph-Anne-Marie-de-Moyriac-de-Mailla,"Being based on the Confucian orthodox text of Zhu Xi, Mailla's ""Histoire générale "" gives an idealised account of Chinese imperial history, which should also be read in context of the Rites controversy. For the time being it remained a sole source on Chinese history available in Europe. As a result, eighteenth-century Enlightenment leaders discussed China as an example of an ideal secular monarchy, a biased vision supported by Voltaire and opposed by Montesquieu."

H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Warring States period
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Warring States period () was an era in ancient Chinese history characterized by warfare, as well as bureaucratic and military reforms and consolidation. It followed the Spring and Autumn period and concluded with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire, known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is the most often cited. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The ""Warring States Period"" derives its name from the ""Record of the Warring States"", a work compiled early in the Han dynasty."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Much later, Japanese historians—well versed in Chinese culture—used the term ""Warring States period"" for the Sengoku period of their own history."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Geography
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The political geography of the era was dominated by the Seven Warring States, namely:"
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Qin located in the far west, with its core in the Wei River Valley and Guanzhong. This geographical position offered protection from the other states but limited its initial influence."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,The Three Jins Located in the center on the Shanxi plateau were the three successor states of Jin. These were:
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Han south, along the Yellow River, controlling the approaches to Qin."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Wei located in the middle, roughly today's eastern Henan Province."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Zhao the northernmost of the three, roughly today's southern Hebei Province as well as northern Shanxi Province."
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,"Qi east, centred on the Shandong Peninsula"
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Chu south, with its core territory around the valleys of the Han River and, later, the Yangtze River."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Yan northeast, centred on modern-day Beijing. Late in the period it pushed northeast and began to occupy the Liaodong Peninsula"
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,Besides these seven major states other smaller states survived into the period. They include:
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,Royal territory of the Zhou king was near Luoyi in the Han area on the Yellow River.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Yue On the southeast coast near Shanghai was the State of Yue, which was highly active in the late Spring and Autumn era but was later annexed by Chu."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Zhongshan Between the states of Zhao and Yan was the state of Zhongshan, which was eventually annexed by Zhao in 296 BC."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,Sichuan states: In the far southwest were the non-Zhou states of Ba (east) and Shu (west). These ancient kingdoms were conquered by Qin later in the period.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Other minor states: There were many minor states which were satellites of the larger ones until they were absorbed. Many were in the Central Plains between the three Jins (west) and Qi (east) and Chu to the south. Some of the more important ones were Song, Lu, Zheng, Wey, Teng and Zou."
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,Periodisation
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,The eastward flight of the Zhou court in 771 BC marks the start of the Spring and Autumn period. No one single incident or starting point inaugurated the Warring States era. The political situation of the period represented a culmination of historical trends of conquest and annexation which also characterised the Spring and Autumn period; as a result there is some controversy as to the beginning of the era. Proposed starting points include:
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"481 BC <br> Proposed by Song-era historian Lü Zuqian, also known as Lü Bogong, since this year marks the end of the ""Spring and Autumn Annals""."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"476–475 BC <br> The author, Sima Qian, of ""Records of the Grand Historian"", chose this date as the inaugural year of King Yuan of Zhou."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"453 BC <br> The Partition of Jin saw the dissolution/destruction of that key state of the earlier period and the formation of three of the seven warring states: Han, Zhao, and Wei."
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,441 BC <br> The inaugural year of Zhou Kings starting with King Ai of Zhou.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"403 BC <br> The year when the Zhou court officially recognised Han, Zhao and Wei as states. Author Sima Guang of ""Zizhi Tongjian"" (published 1084) advocates this symbol of eroded Zhou authority as the start of the Warring States era."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Background and formation
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Eastern Zhou Dynasty began to fall around 5th century BC. They had to rely on other armies in other allied states because their military rule no longer followed. Over 100 smaller states were made into 7 major states which included: Chu, Han, Qin, Wei, Yan, Qi and Zhao. However, there eventually was a shift in alliances because each state's ruler wanted to be independent in power. This caused hundreds of wars between the periods of 535-286 BCE. The victorious state would have overall rule and control in China."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The system of feudal states created by the Western Zhou dynasty underwent enormous changes after 771 BC with the flight of the Zhou court to modern-day Luoyang and the diminution of its relevance and power. The Spring and Autumn period led to a few states gaining power at the expense of many others, the latter no longer able to depend on central authority for legitimacy or protection."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"During the Warring States period, many rulers claimed the Mandate of Heaven to justify their conquest of other states and spread their influence."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The struggle for hegemony eventually created a state system dominated by several large states, such as Jin, Chu, Qin and Qi, while the smaller states of the Central Plains tended to be their satellites and tributaries. Other major states also existed, such as Wu and Yue in the southeast. The last decades of the Spring and Autumn era were marked by increased stability, as the result of peace negotiations between Jin and Chu which established their respective spheres of influence. This situation ended with the partition of Jin, whereby the state was divided between the houses of Han, Zhao and Wei, and thus enabled the creation of the seven major warring states."
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,Partition of Jin (453–403 BC)
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The rulers of Jin had steadily lost political powers since the middle of the 6th century BC to their nominally subordinate nobles and military commanders, a situation arising from the traditions of the Jin which forbade the enfeoffment of relatives of the ducal house. This allowed other clans to gain fiefs and military authority, and decades of internecine struggle led to the establishment of four major families, the Han, Zhao, Wei and Zhi."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Battle of Jinyang saw the allied Han, Zhao and Wei destroy the Zhi family (453 BC) and their lands were distributed among them. With this, they became the ""de facto"" rulers of most of Jin's territory, though this situation would not be officially recognised until half a century later. The Jin division created a political vacuum that enabled during the first 50 years expansion of Chu and Yue northward and Qi southward. Qin increased its control of the local tribes and began its expansion southwest to Sichuan."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Early Warring States
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,The three Jins recognized (403–364 BC)
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"In 403 BC, the Zhou court under King Weilie officially recognized Zhao, Wei and Han as immediate vassals, thereby raising them to the same rank as the other warring states."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,From before 405 until 383 the three Jins were united under the leadership of Wei and expanded in all directions. The most important figure was Marquess Wen of Wei (445–396). In 408–406 he conquered the State of Zhongshan to the northeast on the other side of Zhao. At the same time he pushed west across the Yellow River to the Luo River taking the area of Xihe (literally 'west of the [Yellow] river').
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The growing power of Wei caused Zhao to back away from the alliance. In 383 it moved its capital to Handan and attacked the small state of Wey. Wey appealed to Wei which attacked Zhao on the western side. Being in danger, Zhao called in Chu. As usual, Chu used this as a pretext to annex territory to its north, but the diversion allowed Zhao to occupy a part of Wei. This conflict marked the end of the power of the united Jins and the beginning a period of shifting alliances and wars on several fronts."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"In 376 BC, the states of Han, Wei and Zhao deposed Duke Jing of Jin and divided the last remaining Jin territory between themselves, which marked the final end of the Jin state."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"In 370 BC, Marquess Wu of Wei died without naming a successor, which led to a war of succession. After three years of civil war, Zhao from the north and Han from the south invaded Wei. On the verge of conquering Wei, the leaders of Zhao and Han fell into disagreement about what to do with Wei, and both armies abruptly retreated. As a result, King Hui of Wei (still a Marquess at the time) was able to ascend the throne of Wei."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"By the end of the period Zhao extended from the Shanxi plateau across the plain to the borders of Qi. Wei reached east to Qi, Lu and Song. To the south, the weaker state of Han held the east-west part of the Yellow River valley, surrounded the Zhou royal domain at Luoyang and held an area north of Luoyang called Shangdang."

The throne instead passed to the future King Wei, from the house of Tian. The Tian had been very influential at court towards the end of Jiang rule, and now openly assumed power."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The new ruler set about reclaiming territories that had been lost to other states. He launched a successful campaign against Zhao, Wey and Wei, once again extending Qi territory to the Great Wall. Sima Qian writes that the other states were so awestruck that nobody dared attack Qi for more than 20 years. The demonstrated military prowess also had a calming effect on Qi's own population, which experienced great domestic tranquility during Wei's reign."

PA,196576-Warring-States-period,King Hui of Wei (370–319 BC) set about restoring the state. In 362–359 BC he exchanged territories with Han and Zhao in order to make the boundaries of the three states more rational.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,In 364 BC Wei was defeated by Qin at the Battle of Shimen and was only saved by the intervention of Zhao. Qin won another victory in 362 BC. In 361 BC the Wei capital was moved east to Daliang to be out of the reach of Qin.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"In 354 BC, King Hui of Wei started a large-scale attack on Zhao. By 353 BC, Zhao was losing badly and its capital, Handan, was under siege. The State of Qi intervened. The famous Qi strategist, Sun Bin the great-great-great-grandson of Sun Tzu (author of the Art of War), proposed to attack the Wei capital while the Wei army was tied up besieging Zhao. The strategy was a success; the Wei army hastily moved south to protect its capital, was caught on the road and decisively defeated at the Battle of Guiling. The battle is remembered in the second of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, ""besiege Wei, save Zhao"" meaning to attack a vulnerable spot to relieve pressure at another point."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Domestically, King Hui patronized philosophy and the arts, and is perhaps best remembered for hosting the Confucian philosopher Meng Zi at his court; their conversations form the first two chapters of the book which bears Meng Zi's name."

LI,196576-Warring-States-period,Shang Yang reforms Qin (356–338 BC)
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"During the early Warring States period Qin generally avoided conflicts with the other states. This changed during the reign of Duke Xiao, when prime minister Shang Yang made centralizing and authoritarian reforms in accordance with his Legalist philosophy between the years 356 and 338 BC."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Shang introduced land reforms, privatized land, rewarded farmers who exceeded harvest quotas, enslaved farmers who failed to meet quotas, and used enslaved subjects as rewards for those who met government policies. As manpower was short in Qin relative to the other states at the time, Shang enacted policies to increase its manpower. As Qin peasants were recruited into the military, he encouraged active immigration of peasants from other states into Qin as a replacement workforce; this policy simultaneously increased the manpower of Qin and weakened the manpower of Qin's rivals."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Shang made laws forcing citizens to marry at a young age and passed tax laws to encourage raising multiple children. He also enacted policies to free convicts who worked in opening wastelands for agriculture. Shang abolished primogeniture and created a double tax on households that had more than one son living in the household, to break up large clans into nuclear families. Shang also moved the capital to reduce the influence of nobles on the administration."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The rise of Qin was recognized by the royal court, and in 343 BC the king conferred the title of hegemon on Duke Xiao. As was customary for the designated hegemon, the duke hosted a conference of all the feudal lords, although it did not lead to any lasting peace."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,After the reforms Qin became much more aggressive. In 340 Qin took land from Wèi after it had been defeated by Qi. In 316 Qin conquered Shu and Ba in Sichuan to the southwest. Development of this area took a long time but slowly added greatly to Qin's wealth and power.

The generals from the Battle of Guiling met again (Sun Bin and Tian Ji versus Pang Juan), using the same tactic, attacking Wei's capital. Sun Bin feigned a retreat and then turned on the overconfident Wei troops and decisively defeated them at the Battle of Maling. After the battle all three of the Jin successor states appeared before King Xuan of Qi, pledging their loyalty."

PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Chu rose to its peak in 334 BC, when it conquered Yue to its east on the Pacific coast. The series of events leading up to this began when Yue prepared to attack Qi to its north. The King of Qi sent an emissary who persuaded the King of Yue to attack Chu instead.

LI,196576-Warring-States-period,Horizontal and vertical alliances (334–249 BC)
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Towards the end of the Warring States period, the Qin state became disproportionately powerful compared with the other six states. As a result, the policies of the six states became overwhelmingly oriented towards dealing with the Qin threat, with two opposing schools of thought. One school advocated a 'vertical' or north-south alliance called ""hezong"" (合縱/合纵) in which the states would ally with each other to repel Qin. The other advocated a 'horizontal' or east-west alliance called ""lianheng"" (連橫/连横) in which a state would ally with Qin to participate in its ascendancy."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"There were some initial successes in ""hezong"", though mutual suspicions between allied states led to the breakdown of such alliances. Qin repeatedly exploited the horizontal alliance strategy to defeat the states one by one. During this period, many philosophers and tacticians travelled around the states, recommending that the rulers put their respective ideas into use. These ""lobbyists,"" such as Su Qin (who advocated vertical alliances) and Zhang Yi (who advocated horizontal alliances), were famous for their tact and intellect, and were collectively known as the School of Diplomacy, whose Chinese name (縱橫家, literally 'the school of the vertical and horizontal') was derived from the two opposing ideas."
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,Su Qin and the first vertical alliance (334–300 BC)
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Beginning in 334 BC, the diplomat Su Qin spent years visiting the courts of Yan, Zhao, Han, Wei, Qi and Chu and persuaded them to form a united front against Qin. In 318 BC all states except Qi launched a joint attack on Qin, which however was not successful."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"King Hui of Qin died in 311 BC, followed by prime minister Zhang Yi one year later. The new monarch, King Wu, reigned only four years before dying without legitimate heirs. Some damaging turbulence ensued throughout 307 BC before a son of King Hui by a concubine (i.e. a younger half-brother of King Wu) could be established as King Zhao, who in stark contrast to his predecessor went on to rule for an unprecedented 53 years."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"After the failure of the first vertical alliance, Su Qin eventually came to live in Qi, where he was favored by King Xuan and drew the envy of the ministers. An assassination attempt in 300 BC left Su mortally wounded but not dead. Sensing death approaching, he advised the newly crowned King Min have him publicly executed to draw out the assassins. King Min complied with Su's request and killed him, putting an end to the first generation of Vertical alliance thinkers."

PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"King Min of Qi came to be highly influenced by Lord Mengchang, a grandson of the former King Wei of Qi. Lord Mengchang made a westward alliance with the States of Wei and Han. In the far west, Qin, which had been weakened by a succession struggle in 307, yielded to the new coalition and appointed Lord Mengchang its chief minister. The alliance between Qin and Qi was sealed by a Qin princess marrying King Min. This ""horizontal"" or east-west alliance might have secured peace except that it excluded the State of Zhao."

The remaining three allies, Qi, Wei and Han, attacked Qin, driving up the Yellow River below Shanxi to the Hangu Pass. After 3 years of fighting they took the pass and forced Qin to return territory to Han and Wei. They next inflicted major defeats on Yan and Chu.

Yan had normally been a relatively weak ally of Qi and Qi feared little from this quarter. Yan's onslaught under general Yue Yi came as a devastating surprise. Simultaneously, the other allies attacked from the west. Chu declared itself an ally of Qi but contented itself with annexing some territory to its north. Qi's armies were destroyed while the territory of Qi was reduced to the two cities of Ju and Jimo. King Min himself was later captured and executed by his own followers."

PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"After Chu was defeated in 278, the remaining great powers were Qin in the west and Zhao in the north-center. There was little room for diplomatic maneuver and matters were decided by war in 265–260. Zhao had been much strengthened by King Wuling of Zhao (325–299). In 307 he enlarged his cavalry by copying the northern nomads. In 306 he took more land in the northern Shanxi plateau. In 305 he defeated the northeastern border state of Zhongshan. In 304 he pushed far to the northwest and occupied the east-west section of the Yellow River in the north of the Ordos Loop.

PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"In 265 King Zhaoxiang of Qin made the first move by attacking the weak state of Han which held the Yellow River gateway into Qin. He moved northeast across Wei territory to cut off the Han exclave of Shangdang north of Luoyang and south of Zhao. The Han king agreed to surrender Shangdang, but the local governor refused and presented it to King Xiaocheng of Zhao. Zhao sent out Lian Po who based his armies at Changping and Qin sent out general Wang He. Lian Po was too wise to risk a decisive battle with the Qin army and remained inside his fortifications. Qin could not break through and the armies were locked in stalemate for three years. The Zhao king decided that Lian Po was not aggressive enough and sent out Zhao Kuo who promised a decisive battle. At the same time Qin secretly replaced Wang He with the notoriously violent Bai Qi. When Zhao Kuo left his fortifications, Bai Qi used a Cannae maneuver, falling back in the center and surrounding the Zhao army from the sides. After being surrounded for 46 days, the starving Zhao troops surrendered in September 260 BC. It is said that Bai Qi had all the prisoners killed and that Zhao lost 400,000 men."

However, Wang Jian decided to weaken Chu's resolve and tricked the Chu army by appearing to be idle in his fortifications whilst secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, the Chu defenders decided to disband due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at that point, with full force, and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Chu lost the initiative and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it too was fully conquered with the destruction of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, Lord Changping, in 223 BC.

H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Increasing scale of warfare
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The chariot remained a major factor in Chinese warfare long after it went out of fashion in the Middle East. Near the beginning of the Warring States period there is a shift from chariots to massed infantry, possibly associated with the invention of the crossbow. This had two major effects. First it led the dukes to weaken their chariot-riding nobility so they could get direct access to the peasantry who could be drafted as infantry. This change was associated with the shift from aristocratic to bureaucratic government. Second, it led to a massive increase in the scale of warfare. When the Zhou overthrew the Shang at the Battle of Muye they used 45,000 troops and 300 chariots. For the Warring States period the following figures for the military strengths of various states are reported:"
LI,196576-Warring-States-period,"Qin <br> 1,000,000 infantry, 1,000 chariots, 10,000 horses;"

LI,196576-Warring-States-period,"Battle of Yique <br> 240,000 killed;"
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"General Bai Qi is said to have been responsible for 890,000 enemy deaths over his career."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Many scholars think these numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid by the number of enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it seems clear that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China's traditional and current preference for a united throne."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Military developments
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Warring States period saw the introduction of many innovations to the art of warfare in China, such as the use of iron and of cavalry."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Warfare in the Warring States period evolved considerably from the Spring and Autumn period, as most armies made use of infantry and cavalry in battles, and the use of chariots became less widespread. The use of massed infantry made warfare bloodier and reduced the importance of the aristocracy, which in turn made the kings more despotic. From this period onward, as the various states competed with each other by mobilizing their armies to war, nobles in China belonged to the literate class, rather than to the warrior class as had previously been the case."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The various states fielded massive armies of infantry, cavalry, and chariots. Complex logistical systems maintained by efficient government bureaucracies were needed to supply, train, and control such large forces. The size of the armies ranged from tens of thousands to several hundred thousand men."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,Iron weapons became more widespread and began to replace bronze. Most armour and weapons of this period were made from iron.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The first official native Chinese cavalry unit was formed in 307 BC during the military reforms of King Wuling of Zhao, who advocated 'nomadic dress and horse archery'. But the war chariot still retained its prestige and importance, despite the tactical superiority of cavalry."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The crossbow was the preferred long-range weapon of this period, due to several reasons. The crossbow could be mass-produced easily, and mass training of crossbowmen was possible. These qualities made it a powerful weapon against the enemy."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Infantrymen deployed a variety of weapons, but the most popular was the dagger-axe. The dagger-axe came in various lengths, from 9 to 18 feet; the weapon consisted of a thrusting spear with a slashing blade appended to it. Dagger-axes were an extremely popular weapon in various kingdoms, especially for the Qin, who produced 18-foot-long pike-like weapons."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Military thought
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Warring States was a great period for military strategy; of the Seven Military Classics of China, four were written during this period:"
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"""The Art of War"" <br> It is attributed to Sun Tzu, a highly influential study of strategy and tactics."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"""Wuzi"" <br> It is attributed to Wu Qi, a statesman and commander who served the states of Wei and then Chu."

PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"""The Methods of the Sima"" <br> It is attributed to Sima Rangju, a commander serving the state of Qi."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Culture and society
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Warring States period was an era of warfare in ancient China, as well as bureaucratic and military reforms and consolidation; the major states, ruling over large territories, quickly sought to consolidate their powers, leading to the final erosion of the Zhou court's prestige. As a sign of this shift, the rulers of all the major states (except for Chu, which had claimed kingly title much earlier) abandoned their former feudal titles for the title of 王, or King, claiming equality with the rulers of the Zhou."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"At the same time, the constant conflict and need for innovative social and political models led to the development of many philosophical doctrines, later known as the Hundred Schools of Thought. The most notable schools of thought include Mohism, expounded by Mozi; Confucianism, represented by Mencius and Xunzi, and Legalism, represented by Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Shen Dao and Han Fei, and Taoism, represented by Zhuangzhi and Lao Tzu."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,The many states that were competing between each other attempted to display their power not only militarily but in their courts and state philosophy. Many differing rulers adopted the differing philosophies in their own advantage or that of their kingdom.
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Mencius attempted to instate Confucianism as a state philosophy through proposing that through the governing of moral principles like benevolence and righteousness, the state would win popular support from one state and those neighboring, eliminating the need of a war altogether. Mencius had attempted to convince King Hui of Liang, although was unsuccessful since the king saw no advantage in the period of wars."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Mohism was developed by Mozi (468–376 BC) and it provided a unified moral and political philosophy based on impartiality and benevolence. Mohists had the belief that people change depending on environments around. The same was applied to rulers, which is why one must be cautious of foreign influences. Mozi was very much against warfare, although he was a great tactician in defense. He defended the small state of Song from many attempts of the Chu state."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Taoism was advocated by Laozi, and believed that human nature was good and can achieve perfection by returning to original state. It believed that like a baby, humans are simple and innocent although with development of civilizations it lost its innocence only to be replaced by fraud and greed. Contrarily to other schools, it did not want to gain influence in the offices of states and Laozi even refused to be in the minister of the state of Chu."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Legalism created by Shang Yang in 338 BC, rejected all notions of religion and practices, and believed a nation should be governed by strict law. Not only were severe punishments applied, but they would be grouped with the families and made mutually responsible for criminal act. It proposed radical reforms, and established a society based on solid ranks. Peasants were encouraged to practice agriculture as occupation, and military performance was rewarded. Laws were also applied to all ranks with no exception; even the king was not above punishment. The philosophy was adapted by the Qin state and it created it into a well-organized, centralized state with a bureaucracy chosen on the basis of merit."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"This period is most famous for the establishment of complex bureaucracies and centralized governments, as well as a clearly established legal system. The developments in political and military organization were the basis of the power of the Qin state, which conquered the other states and unified them under the Qin Empire in 221 BC."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,"Nobles, bureaucrats and reformers"
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The phenomenon of intensive warfare, based on mass formations of infantry rather than the traditional chariots, was one major trend which led to the creation of strong central bureaucracies in each of the major states. At the same time, the process of secondary feudalism which permeated the Spring and Autumn period, and led to such events as the partition of Jin and the usurpation of Qi by the Tian clan, was eventually reversed by the same process of bureaucratisation."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The reforms of Shang Yang in Qin, and of Wu Qi in Chu, both centred on increased centralisation, the suppression of the nobility, and a vastly increased scope of government based on Legalist ideals, which were necessary to mobilise the large armies of the period."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Sophisticated arithmetic
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"A bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the Tsinghua collection dated to 305 BC are the worlds' earliest example of a two digit decimal multiplication table, indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Rod numerals were used to represent both negative and positive integers, and rational numbers, a true positional number system, with a blank for zero dating back to the Warring States period."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Literature
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"An important literary achievement of the Warring States period is the Zuo Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, which summarizes the preceding Spring and Autumn period. The less famous work Guoyu is thought to be by the same author."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"Many sayings of Spring and Autumn philosophers, which had previously been circulated orally, were put into writing in the Warring States. These include the Analects and The Art of War."
H1,196576-Warring-States-period,Economic developments
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"The Warring States period saw the proliferation of iron working in China, replacing bronze as the dominant type of metal used in warfare. Areas such as Shu (present-day Sichuan) and Yue (present-day Zhejiang) were also brought into the Chinese cultural sphere during this time. Trade also became important, and some merchants had considerable power in politics, the most prominent of which was Lü Buwei, who rose to become Chancellor of Qin and was a key supporter of the eventual Qin Shihuang."
PA,196576-Warring-States-period,"At the same time, the increased resources of consolidated, bureaucratic states, coupled with the logistical needs of mass levies and large-scale warfare, led to the proliferation of economic projects such as large-scale waterworks. Major examples of such waterworks include the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which controlled the Min River in Sichuan and turned the former backwater region into a major Qin logistical base, and the Zhengguo Canal which irrigated large areas of land in the Guanzhong Plain, again increasing Qin's agricultural output."

PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"Mark Aldrich (January 22, 1802 – September 21, 1873) was a founder of Warsaw, Illinois, and a politician: Illinois state senator for the Whig Party, the first American mayor of Tucson, Arizona, and a three-term territorial senator in Arizona. He was one of five defendants tried and acquitted in Illinois of the murder in 1844 of Joseph Smith, who was founder of the Latter Day Saint movement."
LI,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,Founding of Warsaw and political leadership
PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"Aldrich was born in New York and moved to Hancock County, Illinois, in 1832, where he was one of the early developers of what would later become the town of Warsaw. Aldrich was appointed as the first postmaster of Warsaw, serving between 1834 and 1838. In 1836 and 1838 he was elected to the Illinois Senate as the representative for Hancock County."
LI,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,Early involvement with the Latter Day Saints
PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"In the late 1830s, Latter Day Saints began settling in Hancock County. According to Latter Day Saint leader Joseph Smith, Aldrich spent two years trying to convince Smith and the Latter Day Saints to purchase a section of land south of Warsaw which Aldrich owned."
PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"In 1841, Smith finally relented and some of the Latter Day Saints settled as Aldrich's tenants in what would be called Warren, Illinois. However, once the Latter Day Saints had settled there, Aldrich raised the rent and imposed a number of restrictions on the Latter Day Saints that had not been foreseen. As a result, Smith moved the Latter Day Saints settled in Warren to Nauvoo, where the majority of Latter Day Saints had settled."
PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"Aldrich was unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade Smith to continue their arrangement. As a result, Aldrich filed for bankruptcy on March 22, 1842."
H1,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,Murder trial
PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"Following his disagreements with Smith, Aldrich became an opponent of the Latter Day Saint presence in Hancock County. He was a major in command of the Warsaw Independent Battalion of the Illinois State Militia."
PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"Aldrich was later accused of having directed men under his command to storm Carthage Jail where Smith and his brother were being held in June 1844. Smith and his brother Hyrum were shot dead by a mob that attacked the jail on June 27. On October 26, 1844, Aldrich was indicted for the murder of the two Smiths. At trial, Aldrich and four other defendants were acquitted of the crime by a jury."

PA,12744180-Mark-Aldrich,"Aldrich ran for sheriff of Hancock County in 1846, but lost. He went to California during the gold rush and settled later in Tucson, Arizona. He was elected as the first American mayor of that city, following the US acquisition of the Southwest following the Mexican–American War in 1848."

PA,11659860-1982-in-Afghanistan,"Fighting between the Mujahideen jihadists and the Afghan Army backed by Soviet forces is less widespread as the government appears to be in better control of the insurgency problem in general. Karmal, whose position has been considered shaky, is also firmly in command as his Parcham faction of the ruling PDPA manages to eliminate most of the pro-Khalq elements from the government and the party. Diego Cordovez, UN special representative for Afghanistan, visits the capitals of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran to convince their leaders of the necessity to find a peaceful settlement. Clashes between insurgents and security forces are mainly centred on the Panjsher Valley, about 70 km northeast of Kabul. Bitter fighting takes place in this region during June–August. The Afghan Army and the Soviets commit a large number of ground troops supported by helicopter gunships and MiG jet fighters to dislodge rebels from the valley. Rebel sources in Pakistan admit that the rebels have to take refuge in nearby mountains but insist that they are preparing to fight back. As a result of large-scale operations by Soviet and Afghan forces, Kandahar, in the south, also seems more secure. Western news agency reports estimate casualties in fighting since the Soviet intervention at 20,000 Afghan and 10,000 Soviet troops. Little is known about rebel losses."

PA,17604868-Carlo-Gonzaga-of-Milan,"Carlo Gonzaga (died 21 December 1456), Lord of Sabbioneta, was an Italian nobleman of the Mantuan House of Gonzaga who rose to the position of Captain of the People in the Ambrosian Republic of Milan, and eventually ruled practically as an autocrat. He was the younger son of Gianfrancesco Gonzaga and Paola Malatesta, as well as a friend of the humanist writer Francesco Filelfo. His brother was the famous Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, and became a rival of his for Mantua and in the field of battle."
H1,17604868-Carlo-Gonzaga-of-Milan,Biography
PA,17604868-Carlo-Gonzaga-of-Milan,"Carlo Gonzaga was born in Mantua. He married twice, first to Lucia d'Este, daughter of Niccolò III d'Este, who died childless, and then to Ringarda Manfredi, who gave him three daughters and a son."
PA,17604868-Carlo-Gonzaga-of-Milan,"After the death of his father in 1444 Ludovico became Marquis and removed all authority from Carlo. He went to Venice and fought in her service against the Ambrosian Republic until he defected with Francesco Sforza in 1447. He was appointed Captain of the People in November of that year. He eventually counseled Giovanni Appiano and Giovanni Ossona, the leaders of the Guelphs, in their term in leadership, becoming so powerful that he was raised in all but name to the status of a dictator. He had a lavish house and started replacing men in government to those in his favor. A Ghibelline conspiracy rose against him and his government, but he shattered it, and his Guelph underlings massacred many Ghibellines."
PA,17604868-Carlo-Gonzaga-of-Milan,"Gonzaga made attempts for peace first with Republic of Venice, then with Francesco Sforza, offering the latter the city of Crema. Gonzaga was thrown into jail at first, but shortly after pardoned with many other Guelphs, and made head of a temporary government until the coronation of Sforza. Later, furious at Sforza for making an alliance with Ludovico, he plotted with Guglielmo of Montferrat in 1450 and was thrown into the Pavian prison. He was released when he conceded to give up his war spoils, Alessandria and Tortona."
PA,17604868-Carlo-Gonzaga-of-Milan,"Despite his fall from favor, he was hired by Sforza to fight the Venetian forces under his brother. He was defeated in 1453 at Goito, but nevertheless with the Treaty of Lodi in 1454 Ludovico was forced to give back all he stole from Carlo. Later he was made Lord of Sabbioneta by Sforza. He died heirless, his only son presumably having fallen prey to death in years previous, and his lands passed to his brother Ludovico ΙΙΙ Gonzaga."

H1,1152225-Damiano-Defence,Brief
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,The Damiano Defence is a chess opening beginning with the moves:
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"The defence is one of the oldest chess openings, with games dating back to the 16th century. It is a weak opening, and leads to either a win or a large advantage for White after 3.Nxe5. Even if White does not go for this continuation, simple leads to an advantage since 2...f6 weakened Black's as well as took away the best square for the g8-knight."
LI,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"The ""ECO"" code for the Damiano Defence is C40 (King's Knight Opening)."
LI,1152225-Damiano-Defence,3.d4 and 3.Bc4
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"Black's 2...f6 is a weak move that exposes Black's king, weakens Black's kingside and takes away his knight's best square. The moves 3.d4 and 3.Bc4 are strong replies; I.A. Horowitz wrote (substituting algebraic notation for his descriptive notation), ""Simple and potent is 3.Bc4 d6 4.d4 Nc6 5.c3, after which Black chokes to death."""
LI,1152225-Damiano-Defence,3.Nxe5!
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"Most forceful, however, is the knight sacrifice 3.Nxe5 Taking the knight with 3...fxe5? exposes Black to a deadly attack after 4.Qh5+ Ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.Qxe5+, forking king and rook, leaving Black down the exchange, though other options are worse) 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5! (6...Kg6 7.Qf5+ is devastating and leads to mate shortly after) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? Bd6!) 8...h5 (see diagram; 8...h6 is similar, except Black cannot play 9...Bxb7 because of 10.Qf5) 9.Bxb7! Bd6 (9...Bxb7 10.Qf5+ Kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.Qf7! mates quickly) 10.Qa5!, when Black's best is 10...Nc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8, and now White will be ahead by several pawns. Bruce Pandolfini notes that Black's opening is thus sometimes described as ""the five pawns "". Alternatively, White can continue developing his pieces, remaining four pawns up. In either case, White has a clearly winning position."
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"Since taking the knight is fatal, after 3.Nxe5 Black should instead play 3...Qe7! (Other Black third moves, such as 3...d5, lead to 4. Qh5+! g6 5. Nxg6!) After 4.Nf3 (4.Qh5+? g6 5.Nxg6 Qxe4+ 6.Be2 Qxg6 leaves Black ahead a piece for a pawn) 4...Qxe4+ 5.Be2, Black has regained the pawn but has lost and weakened his kingside, and will lose more time when White chases the queen with Nc3, or 0-0, Re1, and a move by the bishop on e2. Nick de Firmian in ""Modern Chess Openings"" analyses instead 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4, when White had a small advantage in Emmanuel Schiffers–Mikhail Chigorin, St. Petersburg 1897."
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"The fact that Black can only regain the pawn with 3...Qe7! shows that 2...f6? did not really defend the e-pawn at all. Indeed, even a relatively useless move like 2...a6 is less risky than 2...f6? After 2...a6?! 3.Nxe5, Black could still regain the pawn with 3...Qe7 4.d4 d6, when he would have done so without weakening his kingside or depriving his of its best square."
H1,1152225-Damiano-Defence,History
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"The opening is named after the Portuguese chess author Pedro Damiano (1480–1544), despite the fact that he condemned it as weak. In 1847, Howard Staunton wrote of 2...f6, ""This move occurs in the old work of Damiano, who gives some ingenious variations on it. Lopez, and later authors, have hence entitled it 'Damiano's Gambit'."" Instead, Staunton's contemporary George Walker more logically reserved the term ""Damiano Gambit"" for the knight sacrifice played by White on the third move: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5. Staunton referred to [1.e4 e5 2.Nf3] 2...Nc6, a highly respected move then and now, as ""Damiano's defence to the 's opening""."
PA,1152225-Damiano-Defence,"The Damiano Defence is never seen today in top-level play. The greatest player to play the Damiano in serious master competition was Chigorin. As noted above, he played the 3...Qe7 line in a game against Schiffers at St. Petersburg 1897. Chigorin lost his queen on move 10 (see diagram), but Schiffers played so weakly that Chigorin later missed a brilliant and only escaped when Schiffers agreed to a draw in a winning position. Robert McGregor played the Damiano in a 1964 simultaneous exhibition against Bobby Fischer, essaying 3...Qe7 4.Nf3 d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7.Be2 Bf5, and drew, although Fischer did not play the best moves."

BY,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,B. Mccoy
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"Tropical Storm Olga was the fifteenth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. In the second week of December, after the official end of the hurricane season, a low developed east of the northernmost Lesser Antilles. It slowly acquired tropical characteristics, and late on December 10, the NHC declared it Subtropical Storm Olga while just north of Puerto Rico. It was the first post-season storm since Tropical Storm Zeta in the 2005 season, making the 2007 season one of the few with activity both before and after the official bounds of the hurricane season. Olga was only one of a few out of season tropical cyclones to make landfall. The storm made landfall on December 11 on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. Later that evening, Olga transitioned into a tropical storm just after making landfall. Olga tracked over Hispaniola and emerged in the Caribbean Sea. Strong wind shear and dry air caused Olga to weaken into a remnant low early on December 13."
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"The storm impacted many areas affected by Tropical Storm Noel a month earlier. Olga killed a total of 40 people throughout its existence - one in Puerto Rico, two in Haiti, and 37 in the Dominican Republic. Twenty of these were caused by the release of floodgates at a dam in Santiago Province."
H1,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,Meteorological history
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"In the first week of December, a westward-moving upper-level low led to the formation of a broad surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles. With a strong ridge to its northeast, the trough tracked slowly westward, producing scattered convection and some cyclonic turning. On December 8 convection began to persist in association with the trough and an upper-level low. Early on December 9, officials at the Tropical Prediction Center began classifying the system using the Hebert-Poteat technique, and several tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated its development of tropical characteristics. The system, which consisted of a sharp trough with an area of gale force winds to its north, continued westward through an area of moderately warm sea surface temperatures. On December 10 a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its convection had become disorganized and well-removed from the center. Southerly wind shear left the structure asymmetric, and convection steadily increased closer to the center. With an upper-level low situated just south of the center, the National Hurricane Center classified it as Subtropical Storm Olga at 0300 UTC on December 11 while located about 55 miles (85 km) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico."
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"Upon being classified as a subtropical cyclone, Olga maintained well-defined outflow, and located to the southeast of a strong ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone tracked west-southwestward. The storm strengthened slightly while paralleling the north coast of Puerto Rico, and after an increase in convection near the center, Olga made landfall near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic at 1800 UTC on December 11. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm reported a tighter wind gradient and peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), and at 0000 UTC on December 12 the National Hurricane Center reclassified Olga as a tropical cyclone while it was still inland. Convection rapidly weakened as the storm crossed central Hispaniola, and upon reaching the Caribbean Sea the system lacked the convection required for the classification of a tropical cyclone; rainbands well to its northeast maintained stronger winds, though the center became ill-defined with dry air and strong wind shear. Late on December 12, convection increased slightly over the center, though by that time the cyclone weakened to tropical depression status. As significant convection failed to persist, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Olga earlier on December 13 while located about 80 miles (130 km) northwest of Kingston."
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"Its remnants continued west-northwestward with a clear low-level circulation, producing scattered thunderstorms over Cuba and the Cayman Islands with its moisture extending northward into southern Florida. A small cluster of deep convection developed just east of the center, and the low-level circulation remained well-defined as it approached the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. The remnants of Olga turned northward into the Gulf of Mexico as a cold front approached the center from the northwest. Late on December 16 and early on December 17, the low intensified as it approached the west coast of Florida, with sustained winds of tropical storm force, and gusts to hurricane force, being reported at Clearwater Beach. Ultimately, the approaching cold front absorbed the low as it moved across the Florida peninsula. The cold front was associated with a powerful winter storm that affected much of Eastern America during that weekend and killed at least 25 across six US states and three Canadian provinces tapped Olga's moisture, drawing it northeastward mainly offshore the East Coast."
H1,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,Preparations
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"On December 10, the Tropical Prediction Center issued a gale warning for waters north of the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, in association with the precursor disturbance to Olga. Upon it being classified as a subtropical cyclone, the government of the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Engaño along the north coast to its border with Haiti; a tropical storm watch was also issued along the southern coastline to near Santo Domingo. Because winds were well to the north of its center, a tropical storm warning was not issued for Puerto Rico. Prior to it moving ashore, the government of Haiti issued a tropical storm warning for its northern coastline, and later a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as the southeastern Bahamas."
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"The San Juan National Weather Service office issued a flood watch for all of Puerto Rico, including the islands of Culebra and Vieques. Extended periods of heavy rainfall also resulted in flash flood warnings for portions across the island. Ferry service between Fajardo and the islands of Culebra and Vieques was temporarily suspended during the passage of the storm. In the Dominican Republic, officials opened shelters in 15 provinces, with citizens in low-lying areas recommended to stay elsewhere during the passage of the storm; citizens in 22 communities were evacuated."
H1,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,Impact
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"The cyclone dropped light to moderate precipitation across Puerto Rico, peaking at 11.13 inches (283 mm) near Ponce. The rainfall increased levels along several rivers across the island, including the Arecibo Big River which was reported at several feet above flood stage. Its passage left about 79,000 people without power and 144,000 without water. In the northern portion of the island, the rainfall caused a mudslides that buried an automobile, which killed its driver."
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"Heavy rainfall fell across the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10 inches (250 mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially there appeared to be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400 UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6 million gallons (6.1 million liters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66 foot (20 m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15 minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35 people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000 people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500 houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5 billion (2007 DOP, $45 million 2007 USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36 mph (58 km/h)."
PA,14668232-Tropical-Storm-Olga--2007,"While still moving through the western Caribbean sea, heavy rains fell along a trough in its northeast quadrant beginning on December 14, with a total of 7.08 inches/179.8 mm falling at Nettles Island, Florida. The remnant low intensified due to occasional convection forming near and northeast of the center as it approached the Sunshine State. Clearwater Beach recorded a pressure as low as 1002 mb as well as sustained winds reaching 45 mph (72 km/h), with gusts to 78 mph (126 km/h) between 4 and 5 on the morning of December 16. As a cold front approached, the low pressure area became ill-defined and dissipated before reaching Florida's Space Coast."

PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"David Kennedy (born 15 January 1953 in Sligo) is a former racing driver from the Republic of Ireland. He was one of his country's first Grand Prix drivers, and is widely seen as having helped pioneer the Irish move into international racing."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"As well as being a successful racing driver, Kennedy has been a prominent driver manager, a popular Formula One TV analyst, a shareholder with top race winning single seater race teams and a board member at Ireland’s Mondello Park Race Circuit."
H1,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,Biography
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"Kennedy was in the vanguard of a wave of 1970s Irish international racing talent and became Ireland's first winner of a British single seater championship when he won the RAC and Townsend Thoresen Formula Ford 1600 Championships in 1976 driving a Crossle-Minister 30F. He also finished a close second in the European FF1600 series that year. In 1977 he graduated to the factory supported AFMP March European Formula 3 team but the squad folded early in the year and Kennedy soon switched to the small Argo team, scoring a number of giant killing results with the Jo Marquart designed JM1 chassis."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"He finished sixth in the series in 1978 but switched to the British Formula One series before the end of the year scoring a win on his debut with a Theodore Racing run Wolf WR3 at Snetterton. He finished runner up in British F1 in 1979 which helped him to moved into Grand Prix racing with the Shadow team in 1980. However, the team was chronically underfunded and had a poorly engineered DN11 chassis. Teddy Yip of Theodore Racing fame took over ownership of the team after a few races but a new DN12 design turned out to be a similar disappointment. Kennedy did qualify and race in the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix, an event subsequently stripped of its World Championship status."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"After a part season of North American Can Am racing in 1981 with a Frissbee chassis, Kennedy returned to Europe and went on to forge a successful career in sportscar racing, latterly with the factory Mazdaspeed team with whom he raced extensively at Le Mans, Japan and the world sportscar championship in a series of iconic class winning rotary-powered machines."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"Kennedy enjoyed prominence as a member of the exclusive club of professional drivers earning a living in Japan’s lucrative early ‘90s racing scene. He began to move into driver management before his career behind the wheel ended and was responsible for booking the driver team of Johnny Herbert, Volker Weidler and Bertrand Gachot that took Mazda’s, and Japan’s, breakthrough victory at Le Mans in 1991."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"He himself finished fifth overall with former F1 and F3 team-mate Stefan Johansson, and Maurizio Sandro Sala in that famous edition of Le Mans which preceded a full-time move into driver management when his career behind the wheel came to an end in 1994. Among the drivers Kennedy aided in their single seater careers are ex- Jordan Grand Prix F1 driver and Formula Nippon champion Ralph Firman, Formula Nippon Champion Richard Lyons, Formula Palmer Audi Champion and Indy Lights second runner-up Damien Faulkner, all of whom went on to have successful careers in GT and sportscar racing."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,During this period Kennedy developed a career as TV analyst in Formula One racing beginning as permanent co-commentator alongside Peter Collins on RTÉ in Ireland from 1995 to 2003 after which he sat alongside Declan Quigley at F1 races for Setanta Sports from 2004 until 2009.
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"He has had a regular opinion column with the Sunday Independent newspaper for many years, earning a reputation as an incisive analyst with a quirky, lateral view of proceedings in F1 racing."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,"He has always retained a deep interest in club racing and since 1986 has been a director of the Mondello Park race circuit where he began his career in the early 1970s, sitting on the board of the circuit freehold company controlled by former Lola boss Martin Birrane."
PA,1353862-David-Kennedy--racing-driver,Kennedy was part of the consortium that took control of the Ireland team in the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2006.

PA,106758-Oracle--Arizona,"Oracle is the gateway to the road up the ""back side"" of Mount Lemmon, which starts off of American Avenue and currently offers a secondary route to the top. Prior to the construction of the Catalina Highway on the opposite side of the Santa Catalina range, the Oracle Control Road was the only road access to the mountain community of Summerhaven. The term ""control road"" derives from the fact that the direction of traffic was restricted to one-way only, either up or down at alternate times of day, to prevent motorists from having to pass one another on the narrow, steep road. This route is now popular mainly with off-road 4x4 drivers and with off-road or dual-purpose motorcyclists, and should not be attempted by regular passenger cars or street motorcycles. This road ends at the Catalina Highway near Loma Linda."

PA,106758-Oracle--Arizona,"The name ""Oracle"" comes from early prospectors. Albert Weldon came to the area looking for gold and silver. He and some other companions named their first mine ""The Oracle"" after the ship Weldon had traveled on. The community was later named after its first mine, and thus, indirectly, after a ship."
PA,106758-Oracle--Arizona,"The community began to grow in the late 1870s, as gold and silver were discovered, and the Christmas and New Year mines opened. By 1880, a post office had been established."

PA,106758-Oracle--Arizona,"Weldon was soon joined by Alexander McKay, an immigrant from Scotland who located two mining claims named Christmas and New Years because of the days they were discovered. McKay also built a one-room house, the first in the area, and from it, the village grew. When it was time for a post office to be named, Oracle was the name eventually chosen."
PA,106758-Oracle--Arizona,"Mr. Leighton stated that the town of Oracle takes its name from the Oracle Mine which took its name from the ship Oracle and that he believes the ship took its name from an oracle—a shrine dedicated to a particular god where people went to consult a priest or priestess in times of trouble or uncertainty—called the Temple of Apollo at Didyma in present-day Aydin Province, Turkey, not the oracle at Delphi, Greece believed by some to be the origin of the name. He also explained that there were two ships named Oracle made by the same shipbuilder, the second one being launched in 1876 but that this later ship wasn't the boat that Weldon traveled on, as some sources have said."

PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Charles Barnes Towns (1862–1947) conducted experimentation with cures for alcoholism and drug addiction, and helped draft drug control legislation in the United States during the early 20th century."
H1,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Biography
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Charles B. Towns was born in Georgia in the year 1862 on a small farm. In his youth he worked as a farm hand; he later moved into railroading and eventually sold life insurance at which he was successful. He then moved to New York and between 1901–1904 he had a partnership in a brokerage firm that failed. It was at this time he was approached by a mysterious unnamed individual who claimed that he had a cure for drug addictions such as heroin, opium and alcoholism. The mysterious individual suggested to Towns they could make a lot of money from it."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"In spite of Towns' own doctor stating the cure was ridiculous, Towns set out to find addicted people by placing ads for ""drug fiends"" who wanted to be cured. Towns by this time had read all the known literature on drug addiction and alcoholism. By this trial and error approach Towns refined his cure. Towns' reputation spread in the criminal underworld and he treated addicted gangsters. He involved Dr. Alexander Lambert in his venture. Dr. Lambert was a professor at Cornell University Medical College, who as a physician to President Theodore Roosevelt informed various people in government about the Towns-Lambert cure. Towns was eventually sent by the US government to China to assist with the recovery of some of the 160 million drug addicts in the country. By 1908 while in China, Towns claimed to have cured thousands by his methods. Between the years 1910 and 1920 he aided in the drafting of the Boylan Bill and the Harrison Act."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Towns claimed a 90% success rate from his cure based on the reasoning that those people he never heard from again had been cured. Towns' reputation by the 1920s had greatly diminished in the medical community as his claims regarding his cure became more exaggerated. The Towns-Lambert cure bordered on quackery.
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Lambert eventually broke off his association with Towns Hospital. Towns was making claims that his cure was guaranteed to work for any compulsive behavior, from morphinism to nicotinism to caffeinism, to kleptomania and bedwetting. Lambert realized that the percentage of those deemed to be cured needed to be greatly reduced since he had observed that a number of people over the years kept returning for cure after cure. During the 1920s a large part of the hospital revenues was from repeat business."
LI,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,The Belladonna Cure
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"The formula for Towns-Lambert cure was the deliriant, ""Atropa belladonna"", also called deadly nightshade. The effects of belladonna include delirium, hallucinations, light sensitivity, confusion, and dry mouth. The second ingredient in the mixture was another deliriant, ""Hyoscyamus niger"", also known as henbane, hog's bean, or insane root. It contained two alkaloids, hyoscyamine and hyoscine. The third major ingredient was the dried bark or berries of ""Xanthoxylum americanum"", or prickly ash, added to help with diarrhea and intestinal cramps. The dosage given was determined by the physiologic reaction of each patient. When the face became flushed, the throat dry, and the eyes dilated, the amount of the mixture was reduced or stopped."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"The mixture was given every hour, day and night, for nearly 50 hours. The end of the treatment was marked by the abundance of stools and then castor oil was given to the patient as a further purgative."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,The treatment was also described as 'puke and purge'.
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Every 12 hours the patient was given CC (Compound Cathartic) pills and Blue Mass. These were 19th century medications of varying composition. Blue Mass included mercury, and was prescribed for a cornucopia of ailments."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"When a patient was admitted to the hospital while intoxicated or at the end of a spree, the first thing that was done was to put the patient to sleep. The only medication given prior to the hypnotic was the four CC pills. The hypnotic Lambert found best contained chloral hydrate and morphine along with one or two grams of paraldehyde. If the patient went to sleep easily on this hypnotic it was safe to wake him every hour for his belladonna regimen. Dr Lambert believed it was important to administer a small amount of strychnine every four hours."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,The week following the treatment a diet of a special tonic and simple and easy to digest meals would relax the patient.
LI,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Towns Hospital
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Charles B. Towns Hospital was located at 293 Central Park West in Manhattan. Towns started the hospital in 1901, and the roaring twenties and the increase in alcoholism made it successful. However, after the stock market crash of 1929 admissions to the hospital had significantly declined. The hospital aimed at drying out the well-to-do patient. It was an expensive detoxification facility and one was not admitted unless the fee was paid in advance or a backer guaranteed to pay the fee which in those days was $200 to $350 for a five-day stay."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,At this time the Chief of Staff was Dr. William Duncan Silkworth. Silkworth had lost all his savings in the market collapse and he had come to Towns to help alcoholics.
H1,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Literature
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Towns wrote three important books on alcoholism. These were ""Habits That Handicap"" in 1915, which was given a review in the New York Times, ""Reclaiming the Drinker"" in 1931, and ""Alcohol and Drug Sickness"" in 1934."
H1,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Influences
H1,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Corporations
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,It was Towns' belief that lack of occupation was the destroyer of men; helping the alcoholic was useless if the man had no job to which he could return. He promoted the idea of educational plans to enlighten people on the hazards of drinking along with the idea that society was to blame for the problem of alcohol hence society needed to take responsibility for those who lost control of their drinking.
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,It was during the period from 1910 to the 1930s that Towns encouraged corporations and big institutions to help alcoholics while they were still on the job.
LI,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,Alcoholics Anonymous
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Bill Wilson, cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), was admitted to Towns Hospital three times between 1933 and 1934. On his third and last stay he showed signs of delirium tremens and was treated with the Belladonna Cure. He thought this would help his alcoholism but he inevitably drank within 3 months of leaving the hospital after ""successfully"" completing the Belladonna Cure. It was only after meeting a member of the Oxford, Ebby Thacher, who is later discussed, and undergoing the Oxford Group's ""soul surgery"", did he experience a ""white light experience"" or a spiritual awakening. After that experience, he never drank again."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Wilson's description of his experience: ""All at once I found myself crying out, ""If there is a God, let Him show himself! I am ready to do anything, anything! Suddenly the room lit up with a great white light. I was caught up in an ecstasy which there are no words to describe. It seemed to me in my mind's eye, that I was on a mountain and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing. And then it burst upon me that I was a free man. Slowly the ecstasy subsided. I lay there on the bed, but now for a time I was in another world, a new world of consciousness... and I thought to myself, ""So this is the God of the preachers!"" A great peace stole over me."" Earlier that evening, Wilsons old drinking buddy, Ebby Thacher, a member of the Oxford Group, who had impressed Wilson by going sober with help of spirituality, had visited and tried to persuade Wilson to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol."
PA,18217517-Charles-B--Towns,"Towns was a supporter and creditor of Alcoholics Anonymous, lending Wilson $2500 ($38000 in 2008 dollar values) to enable him to write what became ""The Big Book"" of Alcoholics Anonymous. He later told the AA story to a writer who had it published in Liberty Magazine which led to the sale of several hundred Big Books. He also offered Wilson, who had been unemployed for several years, a job as a lay therapist, which Wilson declined."

H2,14877600-ANKRD1,ANKRD1
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"CARP, also known as Cardiac adriamycin-responsive protein or Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ""ANKRD1"" gene. CARP is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and is a transcription factor involved in development and under conditions of stress. CARP has been implicated in several diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and several skeletal muscle myopathies."
H1,14877600-ANKRD1,Structure
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"Human CARP is a 36.2kDa protein composed of 319 amino acids., though in cardiomyocytes, CARP can exist as multiple alternatively spliced forms. CARP contains five tandem ankyrin repeats. Studies have shown that CARP can homodimerize. Studies have also shown that CARP is N-terminally, post-translationally cleaved by calpain-3 in skeletal muscle, suggesting alternate bioactive forms of CARP exist. CARP has been localized to nuclei and Z-discs in animal and human myocytes, and at intercalated discs in human cells."
H1,14877600-ANKRD1,Function
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"CARP was originally identified as a YB-1-associating, cardiac-restricted transcription co-repressor in the homeobox NKX2-5 pathway that is involved in cardiac ventricular chamber specification, maturation and morphogenesis, and whose mRNA levels are exquisitely sensitive to Doxorubicin, mediated through a hydrogen peroxide/ERK/p38MAP kinase-dependent as well as M-CAT ""cis-element""-dependent mechanism. Subsequent studies showed that CARP expression in cardiomyocytes is regulated by alpha-adrenergic signaling, in part via the transcription factor GATA4. An additional study showed that beta-adrenergic signaling via protein kinase A and CaM kinase induces the expression of CARP, and that CARP may have a negative effect on contractile function. CARP has also been identified as a transcriptional co-activator of tumor suppressor protein p53 for stimulating gene expression in muscle; p53 was found to be an upstream effector of CARP via upregulation of the proximal ANKRD1 promoter. CARP has a relatively short half-life being longer in cardiomyocytes than endothelial cells; and CARP is degraded by the 26S proteasome via a PEST degron."
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"In animal models of disease and injury, CARP has been characterized to be a stress-inducible myofibrillar protein. CARP has been shown to play a role in skeletal muscle structure remodeling, and repair, being expressed in skeletal muscle near myotendinous junctions, and in vascular smooth muscle cells, as a downstream target of TGF-beta/Smad sigmaling in response to balloon injury and atherosclerotic plaques. Further studies have identified a role for CARP in initiation and regulation of arteriogenesis. Decreased expression of CARP in cardiac cells within the ischemic region was detected in a rat model of ischemic injury, and was thought to be linked to the induction of GADD153, an apoptosis-related gene. In cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin, a model of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, CARP mRNA and protein levels were depleted, myofilament gene transcription was attenuated and sarcomeres showed significant disarray."
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"In a transgenic mouse model of cardiac-specific overexpression of CARP, mice exhibited normal physiology at baseline, but were protected against pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced via pressure-overload or isoproterenol, which could be attributed to the downregulation of the ERK1/2, MEK and TGFbeta-1 pathways. Another study demonstrated that adenoviral overexpression of CARP in cardiomyocytes enhances cardiac hypertrophy induced by Angiotensin II or pressure-overload and promotoes cardiomyocyte apoptosis via p53 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, transgenic knockout models of either CARP alone or CARP in combination with the other muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), ANKRD2 and ANKRD23 demonstrated a lack of cardiac phenotype; mice displayed normal cardiac function at baseline and in response to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that these proteins are not essential."
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"Interactions between CARP and the sarcomeric proteins myopalladin and titin suggest that it may also be involved in the myofibrillar stretch-sensor system. Passive stretch in fetal cardiomyocytes induced differential CARP distribution at nuclei and I-band titin N2A regions. In a mouse model of muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) caused by a small deletion in titin, CARP mRNA expression was shown to be 30-fold elevated in skeletal muscle tissue."
H1,14877600-ANKRD1,Clinical significance
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"A wide spectrum of clinical features have been associated with ""ANKRD1""/CARP. Mutations in ""ANKRD1"" have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, two of which result in altered binding with TLN1 and FHL2. Mutations in ""ANKRD1"" have also been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and have shown to increase binding of CARP to Titin and MYPN. Examination of the functional effects of CARP hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in engineered heart tissue demonstrated that Thr123Met was a gain-of-function mutation exhibiting augmented contractile properties; whereas Pro52Ala and Ile280Val were unstable and failed to incorporate into sarcomeres, an effect that was remedied upon proteasome inhibition via epoxomicin."
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"A missense mutation in ""ANKRD1"" was shown to be associated with the congenital heart defect, Anomalous pulmonary venous connection. CARP has been found as a sensitive and specific biomarker for the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. ""ANKRD1"" mRNA levels correlate with patient platinum sensitivity, thus ANKRD1 associates with platinum-based chemotherapy treatment outcome in ovarian adenocarcinoma patients."
PA,14877600-ANKRD1,"CARP and mRNA expression has been shown to be upregulated in left ventricles of heart failure patients. Studies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital myopathy, also found altered expression of CARP in skeletal muscle fibers. Another study in congenital muscular dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients showed elevated expression of CARP. CARP expression is also elevated in patients with lupus nephritis, and associates with proteinuria severity, suggesting that it may have biomarker potential."

PA,163381-Eamonn-Andrews,"Between 1955 and 1964, he presented the long-running ""Sports Report"" on BBC's Light Programme (now Radio 2). In 1965, he left the BBC to join the ITV contractor ABC, where he pioneered the talk show format in the UK. He hosted a chat show on ITV, ""The Eamonn Andrews Show"" for five years. He was known for coming up with off-the-cuff linkings that did not work, such as: ""Speaking of cheese sandwiches, have you come far?"" This was parodied by the character Seamus Android on ""Round the Horne"" in the 1960s, performed by Bill Pertwee. In the 1960s and 1970s he presented Thames Television's ""Today"" news magazine programme."
PA,163381-Eamonn-Andrews,"He was probably best known as the presenter of the UK version of ""This Is Your Life"", between its inception in 1955 and his death in 1987, when he was succeeded by Michael Aspel (who had also succeeded Andrews as the host of ""Crackerjack"" more than twenty years earlier). Andrews was the first ""This Is Your Life"" subject on British television when he was surprised by the show's creator, Ralph Edwards. Andrews also created a long-running panel game called ""Whose Baby?"" that originally ran on the BBC and later on ITV. He was a regular presenter of the early Miss World pageants."
PA,163381-Eamonn-Andrews,"Andrews' chaired the Radio Éireann Authority (now the RTÉ Authority) between 1960 and 1964, overseeing the introduction of state television to the Republic of Ireland and establishing the broadcaster as an independent semi-state body. About this time, he also acquired a number of business interests in Ireland, including recording studios and a dance hall. Andrews stepped down from the RTE Authority amidst a bitter political storm over what was seen as the controversial content of ""The Late Late Show"". Andrews before leaving RTE defended the show as 'freedom of expression'."

PA,163381-Eamonn-Andrews,"After months of illness during 1987, originally caused by a virus contracted during a plane journey (but which was not recognised at the time), Andrews died from heart failure on 5 November 1987 aged 64 at the Cromwell Hospital in London."
PA,163381-Eamonn-Andrews,"He had recorded his last edition of ""This Is Your Life"" six days previously on 30 October 1987. After his death, the show, and two others that had yet to be broadcast, were postponed until, with his widow's permission, they were broadcast in January 1988."

PA,15804018-WSWN,"WSWN (900 AM) is a radio station formerly broadcasting a talk format branded as ""Talk of the Palm Beaches."" It was better known in the South Florida and Treasure Coast areas as ""Sugar 900,"" named after the surrounding sugar cane industry in the Belle Glade and Pahokee area. The station is licensed to serve 18 counties across South Florida in the United States, and the Caribbean."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"The station is currently owned by JVC Media, LLC, through licensee JVC Broadcasting, LLC. It was purchased along with sister FM station 93.5 FM on September 29, 2014, and the studios moved to Palm Beach Gardens along with WSVU/960 and two FM translators (W240CI at 95.9 FM in West Palm Beach and a Jupiter-based translator W295BJ at 106.9 FM) broadcasting the syndicated adult contemporary format (Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel) of 960AM."
H1,15804018-WSWN,History
PA,15804018-WSWN,"WSWN-AM signed on as a daytime-only station October 5, 1947, broadcasting on 900 kHz with 1 kW power and was owned by Seminole Broadcasting Company. Licensed to Belle Glade, it was initially knowns as ""The Mighty Ninety"" (the same Seminole's WEAS in Savannah, Georgia) for many years since most radios of the time dropped the last zero of the frequency on their dials. Dee Rivers, the owner and operator of Seminole, branded both stations with the same positioning and ID's, since the signals of 900 kHz in Savannah and WSWN at 900 kHz in Belle Glade had overlapping coverage patterns, giving car based listeners a continuous, consistent format from Central Florida to Southern Georgia."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"After WSWN won FCC approval to go to a 24-hour broadcast schedule, it rebranded as the ""Little Station with the Long Reach"" for its ability to be heard as far away as Charleston and Mobile from dusk till dawn. This extended coverage was in spite of its 1,000-watt signal barely reaching the western coastal city of West Palm Beach during the day."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Over the years, attempts at raising the power of WSWN 900 AM were blocked by the FCC due to signal overlap issues with WMOP 900 AM in the Gainesville-Ocala, Florida area. Destine to broadcast as a local-only station during the day, the 1970s saw WSWN's nighttime listenership erode with the emergence of country music powerhouses like WQAM in Miami and WIRK in West Palm Beach."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By that point, WSWN adopted a Southern Gospel and Country mix, with a niche Southern Gospel morning show, to appeal to the African American demographic of its Belle Glade coverage that was approximately 65 percent black. Then, in the early 90s, WSWN's new owners, Rivers Broadcasting. hired Joe Fisher as program director, who convinced Rivers to flip the format to what was then referred to as R&B, with a strong emphasis on Black Gospel. Rivers also had a long-forgotten station in Savannah, Georgia, which also carried an exclusive R&B format from the late 1940s until 1960, when it changed to a country music format. Eventually, due to popular demand, this station returned R&B to the station in the late night hours, as hosted by ""Nat The Cat,"" who played a variety R&B music until the early 80s. His segment and time slot were affectionately known as Nat the Cat with Hot Butter Soul and also ran for a time at WSWN in Belle Glade. This led to Nat being known as the ""First Black DJ of the Glades."" Another popular host of WSWN was the down-to-earth, homespun Jimmy Sims, an American Gospel-type character from Alabama who had previously enjoyed success at a long-forgotten station in DeFuniak Springs, Florida. By the 1980s, on the Sugar airwaves, he was known as ""Reverend Sims,"" though he was never formally ordained by the church."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"It was at the point, with the popularity of ""Reverend Sims,"" that WSWN repositioned with the moniker of ""Sugar 900"" (pronounced Suga-900)—a heartfelt reference to the number one industry in the Glades: Sugarcane farming and processing. While the station held onto the country format, it retained the black gospel music and preaching programming on Saturdays and Sundays. During this time, WSWN first began brokering airtime to local black ministries for the sake of financial survival."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Meanwhile, Belle Glade's lone FM frequency at 93.5 was also purchased by Rivers Broadcasting in 1965—and left dark for over a decade. It finally went on the air as WSWN-FM on October 10, 1978. On June 19, 1989, the station changed its call sign to the current WBGF. Rivers' plans to boost the signal of WSWN-FM to appeal to Hispanic audiences in Cuba were stymied because of the station's ineffective radiation pattern. At that point, being forced to put the station on the air or lose the frequency, Rivers put a Country format on 93.5 FM, broadcasting at 10,000 watts broadcast from a 420 ft. tower—the maximum power and tower height allowed by the FCC, due to 93.5 FM's close proximity to an airport and overlap issues with similar, 93.5 FM frequencies in the Vero Beach and Key Largo, Florida areas. Once again, as with 900 AM, another Belle Glade-based station was relegated to ""local-only"" status. Even with its own signal issues, ""Sugar 900"" soon prospered as a 24-hour black gospel station; meanwhile, WSWN 93.5 FM struggled to find an audience with a 24-hour country format."
H1,15804018-WSWN,The 80s
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By the early 80s, with PD Joe Fisher allegedly fighting a crack cocaine addiction; an epidemic that swept the Belle Glade area, WSWN AM and FM floundered without direction. A series of forgotten, short lived PD's and program consultants failed to turn the AM FM combo around, and the station was regulated to hiring interns and fresh-faced graduates from the Connecticut School of Broadcasting as board operators, producers, and on-air hosts keep the station on the air."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Phil Haire (affectionately come to be dubbed by the listeners as the ""Glades Radio Boss"") came to operate the stations for Rivers Broadcasting in the late 1980s and into the early 1990s. He eventually appointed his daughter, Tammy, as the program director for both stations. Eventually becoming the stations' General Manager upon her father's departure, Tammy flipped the country format of WSWN 93.5 FM to an adult contemporary ""Soft Hits"" format. WAFC 590 AM in the neighboring town of Clewiston, Florida, seeing a formatting hole, jumped on the country format. Even with its weak 930 watt signal, WAFC succeed where WSWN failed and found success with the county format. It was during this time Tammy Haire was dedicated to making 93.5 a winner and completed nearly $35,000.00 in improvements to the studios at WSWN-FM (now known as WBGF)."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Phil Haire eventually mended his fences with Marie, the widowed owner of Rivers Broadcasting (then known as Seminole Broadcasting), once he successfully completed his cancer treatments. With Phil back in place, he fully automated the ""new"" WBGF 93.5 FM, and struck a deal to carry the old Jones Radio Networks' programming for $250.00 per station, per month, which also included an additional investment of $10,000 in computer automation equipment. The institution of automation saved money in the long run, as it reduced the stations' payrolls by an estimated 50 percent."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Haire also became one of the first groundbreaking broadcasters to institute a wide spread brokering format, selling blocks of airtime to anyone—regardless of their absence of any previous radio experience. Suddenly, the R&B/Gospel and Country music automated formats provided by Jones Radio Networks became nothing more than filler for unsold brokered airtime that supported the station-WSWN and WBGF aired a mixture of infomericals, broadcast ministries, political programs, and agency media sponsored programs, along with health, legal, and financial professionals selling goods and services to the Belle Glade and West Palm Beach areas. Haire would pass away in 2006."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"While brokered programming of airtime—on a limited basis—certainly wasn't new to radio, Haire was the first to aggressively expand time brokering into an actual ""format"" and ""programming"" edict. Thus, with the automation filling unsold airtime, and time brokered host that only required ""non-talent"" board operators, WSWN-AM and WBGF-FM completely eliminated all programming and DJ positions at the station—no ""program director"" was needed; just an office/sales manager to sell and schedule brokered shows into whatever ""open slots"" were available, with no worry or care as to what programs aired when or where on the schedule. As result of Haire's newly found financial success with his all-inclusive brokered ""format""—it quickly became the new business model for struggling, low wattage and limited coverage, local AMs and FMs across the U.S. Even as AM stations in larger metropolitan areas began to see their audiences erode in the late 80s, they also began instituting Haire's groundbreaking mix of automation and time brokering of airtime. Today, these stations still employ this method of programming, only now they utilize the Internet, iPod, and satellite services."
H1,15804018-WSWN,The 90s
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By 1996, WSWN-AM and WBGF-FM had been on the block for several years, as Marie Rivers wanted to retire from the broadcasting business. In stepped two business partners from New York calling themselves ""Atlas News & Information Service, Inc."" David Lampel was the hands-on ""radio man"" who had worked his way from a DJ to a program director and eventually as a General Manager at WLIB in New York City, then to the position of Senior Vice President of the station's parent company—Inner City Broadcasting Corporation. Lampel's partner, Michael Wach, was a sales and administration specialist with connections, and had served as vice president and general manager of WLNY-TV on Long Island and held executive positions with WPIX-TV in New York and Boston's WHDH-TV. Together, they had already purchased a television station and several radio stations in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Under Lampel and Wach's direction, WBGF-FM and WSWN-AM were united with a 100,000 watt FM in Islamorada in the central Florida Keys as ""BGI Broadcasting."" Their first move was flip WBGF-FM to Jones Radios' new ""Hot Country Format"" and positioned the station as ""Big Dawg Country"" and developed a live and local morning show. WSWN-AM was flipped to the ""Urban Gold"" format offered by the ABC Radio Networks, while continuing with live and local Gospel music programming on Saturdays from 6 to 10 AM and Sundays from 6 AM to 6 PM—sometimes longer, depending on how much airtime was sold/purchased by local churches to support the black gospel format."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"In 1998, Michael Wach sold his interest in ""Atlas News & Information Service, Inc."" to become vice president and general manager at WNYW/FOX 5 TV in New York, the Fox Network's flagship station. This left Lampel as majority shareholder and outright owner of the AM and FM combo. Since Lampel directed operations from New York, the stations retained the status quo—with more employees dismissed to streamline operations. By 1999, the entire staff (including part-time) consisted of less than 10 staffers (board operators to engineer the brokered programming)."
H1,15804018-WSWN,The 2000s
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By 2000, the decision was made for WSWN and WBGF to swap their respective studios. The more financially viable WSWN ""Sugar 900"" moved from its cramped, antiquated studios into the state of the art WBGF-FM studios (built during the Tammy Haire years); while the failing FM was placed inside WSWN-AM's old studios."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"These programming changes led to personal changes for the popular Jimmy ""Reverend"" Sims, who managed to keep his job through the various format changes and ownerships. For years Sims had battled a variety of ailments including severe arthritis that left him with gnarled digits and painful joints. He was physically unable to stand for long periods at the much higher console in the former FM studio. When the counter-height chairs that had been provided still complicated his condition, ownership was unmoved and offered no further compromise. Sims was slowly fazed-out from the airwaves of WSWN. The inevitable wave of complaints from loyal listeners and the threat of a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act changed nothing. Sims long 38-year association with broadcasting in the Glades came to an unceremonious end."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"After Sims' departure, the stations continued to be owned by Atlas News & Information, Inc./BGI Broadcasting—which relocated from New York to Las Vegas. WSWN remained a Gospel station, but WBGF eventually ditched Jones and ABC Networks' programming and produced a local-in-house Mexican Regional format to service the ethnic sharecroppers of the Belle Glade area, where the population demographic had long since shifted from being African American/Caribbean-based to Latin/Mexican. With the new Mexican format, 93.5 WBGF became known as ""Radio Lobo."" Phil Haire remained as GM until his death in April 2006 and he was replaced by Mike D'Augustine as Station and General Manager."
H1,15804018-WSWN,2014 to 2017
PA,15804018-WSWN,"Then, on September 29, 2014, WSWN ""Sugar 900"" was no more, as the station was purchased by JVC Broadcasting of New York—along with WSWN's FM sister station, WBGF 93.5. Retaining its call letters, WSWN flipped to brokered and satellite talk as ""The Talk of the Palm Beaches,"" and carried a live and local morning news and talk program hosted by local radio mainstays Gerard Campell (formerly of WFTL 850 AM ""News Talk"") and Lindy Rome (of Sunny 104.3 FM). WBGF 93.5 dumped the regional Mexican programming and became ""93.5 The Bar"" with an Alternative Active Rock format and carried the controversial and syndicated ""Bubba the Love Sponge"" radio program."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By May 19, 2017, ANCO Media Group purchased WBGF 93.5 and rebranded it as a dance rock format, ""Revolution 93.5"" creating a mini-South Florida radio network—mirroring a station the Keys, and two FM translators, one in Dade and one in Broward County."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By November 2017, JVC Media co-founder Vic Canales, in a pair of deals worth a combined $751,111, sold his ownership position in the company. Canales—better known by his on-air name ""Vic Latino""—stuck a deal to swap his stake in the nine-year old company for a trio of signals. Canales exchanged his shares worth a combined $450,000 for oldies WSVU (960) and two translators: the North Palm Beach, FL-licensed translator W240CI at 95.5 FM and the Jupiter, FL-licensed translator W295BJ at 106.9 FM. Together the three signals were/are branded as ""True Oldies Channel 95.9-106.9."" Once the deal closed, JVC Media continued to own and operate WSWN 900 AM."
PA,15804018-WSWN,"By December 1, 2017, WSWN-AM 900 dumped its network satellite, time brokered catch-all of health, legal, financial, and entertainment infomercial programming as ""The Talk of the Palm Beaches"" and returned to 24-hour brokered black gospel programming as the ""New Sugar 900."" Now, during its unsold airtime, it runs black gospel music as its filler programming. The station brought back Sugar 900's most recent and extremely popular morning show host, ""Church Boy,"" with his 6 to 10 am weekday morning show and Gospel radio veteran Dawn Brady who first made her voice heard to Sugar 900 listeners in 2008. The broadcast industry publications ""Radio and Television Business Report"", ""All Access"", ""Radio Insight"" confirmed the sale of WSWN 900 AM to James Leger's Sugar Broadcasting."
PA,15804018-WSWN,Meanwhile 93.5 WBGF is currently in the midst of a deal that will result in the station to become one of the United States' first foreign owned broadcast facilities—by Marco Mazzoli an extremely popular Italian/Milan-based radio personality.
LI,15804018-WSWN,The influence of Harvey J. Poole Sr. on WSWN and WBGF
PA,15804018-WSWN,"No commentary on the history of radio in the Glades, and specifically WSWN and WBGF, would be complete without the mention of Harvey J. Poole Sr. Born in Georgia, Poole came to Belle Glade in the 1930s. Following several menial jobs Poole landed at WSWN in 1947 and over the next five decades served loyally in various roles, most notably air personality and account executive—all the while suffering racial indignities from an alleged attempted lynching by area teenagers, to extreme prejudice by landlords and employers. He quietly built a large stable of clients and became known to listeners as the ""Ebony Voice of the Glades"" for his deep-throated tones that could be equally thunderous or velvety soft. Somewhere in there he managed to buy a home, run several of his own businesses, become a pillar of church & community and raise 4 children with his wife. Close associates knew him as Brother Poole and greatly respected his age and gentle wisdom. Poole passed away on April 23, 2008, at the age of 94. Poole's son, Harvey Jr., (known professionally on-air as Harvey J) soon became the program director of WSWN."

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Wilfrid Laurier University in 1991, and has completed course work for a Master of Arts degree at the University of Windsor. During the 1990s, he was a job developer for the Association for Persons with Physical Disabilities and a program coordinator for the Multicultural Council of Windsor and Essex County."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"Masse gained local prominence in 1996 for his opposition to a dance bar that was planned for a residential neighbourhood. He was elected for Ward 2 of the Windsor city council in 1997, and was re-elected in 2000. In 1998, he played a prominent role in preventing a rock-crushing operation from opening in the Wellington Avenue area."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"In May 2001, the Windsor city council unanimously approved Masse's motion to prevent school boards from selling vacant property lots at the highest market value. His purpose was to dissuade boards from closing schools, though some criticized the motion as working against taxpayer interests. Masse later called for a referendum on a proposed new arena project, but this was not accepted by council."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"Brian Masse has a son and daughter named Wade Masse and Alexandria Masse. Wade Masse was born December 8, 2003. Alexandria Masse was born September 26, 2000. He also has a wife Terry Chow."
LI,1481816-Brian-Masse,Member of Parliament
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"Masse joined the federal New Democratic Party in 1997, and was first elected to the Canadian parliament in a by-election held on May 13, 2002. The election was called after the resignation of Herb Gray, a long-time Liberal cabinet minister who had been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1962. Masse won the NDP nomination without opposition, and defeated Liberal candidate Richard Pollock by 2,477 votes to win the seat. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the 2004 general election. Masse's success in 2002 was partly due to support from Joe Comartin, a fellow Windsor New Democrat who was elected to the House of Commons in the 2000 federal election. In 2002-03, Masse supported Comartin's bid for the NDP leadership."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"Masse served as the NDP critic for Auto Policy, Canada Border Services, and Customs in the 38th Canadian parliament. He also became a member of the newly formed all-party ""Border Caucus"", examining aspects of Canada-U.S. trade relations. He introduced a motion in 2004 to restrict large pharmaceutical companies from renewing their patent protection, and has worked in support of Stephen Lewis's efforts to bring affordable AIDS drugs to Africa."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"During his first campaign for the House of Commons, the ""Windsor Star"" newspaper ran an editorial opposing him as ""a bench-warmer, a yes-man, a political careerist"". Two years later, however, a leading ""Star"" columnist wrote that Masse had ""vastly exceeded expectations and quickly developed into an able, hard-working representative who has stayed on top of riding issues""."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"Masse was re-elected in the 2006 federal election with an increased majority over Liberal Werner Keller. He currently serves as NDP Deputy Industry Critic. After the election, Masse and Comartin spoke out against the provincial NDP's decision to remove Canadian Auto Workers leader Buzz Hargrove from the party."
PA,1481816-Brian-Masse,"Masse has criticized Industry Minister Maxime Bernier's plans to deregulate Canada's telecommunications market and ease restrictions on foreign ownership, arguing that the reforms could result in a small number of companies controlling the Canadian industry."

PA,16895696-Dindisc,"Dindisc (often rendered DinDisc) was a UK record label, an imprint of Virgin Records but operating semi-independently, which issued new releases from mid-1979 through early 1982. It is no longer active, but CD reissues on Virgin still mention the label and have Dindisc catalogue numbers."
PA,16895696-Dindisc,"The imprint was founded and run by Carol Wilson, who had previously discovered Sting and signed him to Virgin's music publishing company. Talking about the signing of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark to Dindisc, she later said: ""OMD were a perfect fit for what I had in mind for DinDisc — they had a serious, artistic side with real depth, as well as a commercial, pop side. That duality was reflected in all the early DinDisc signings, like Martha and the Muffins, and then the Monochrome Set."""
PA,16895696-Dindisc,"Many of the company's sleeves were designed by the in-house designer Peter Saville. Saville had started at Factory Records, but came to Wilson's attention when she signed Factory band OMD; she had been particularly interested by Saville's thermographic paper sleeve for the Factory release of ""Electricity"". Saville delivered the artwork for the Dindisc release of ""Electricity"""
PA,16895696-Dindisc,"and asked Wilson if Dindisc needed an art director. Saville and Ben Kelly won a Designers and Art Directors Award for their work on the album ""Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark""."
PA,16895696-Dindisc,"The label's first release (DIN-1) was ""Where's The Boy For Me"" by the Rezillos, released in September 1979. The label's most notable chart successes included Martha and the Muffins' ""Echo Beach"" (UK #5 in 1980) and several early singles by OMD, including ""Enola Gay"", ""Souvenir"", ""Joan of Arc"" and ""Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)"" all of which hit the UK top 10 in 1980/81."
PA,16895696-Dindisc,"The label ceased operations after the release of Hot Gossip's ""I Don't Depend On You"" (DIN-39) in February 1982, after Wilson failed to obtain a shareholding. The dissolution of Dindisc led to Saville and Brett Wickens establishing their own studio, Peter Saville Associates."

PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,"The Palace of Ardashir Pāpakan (in ""Dezh-e Ardashir Pāpakān""), also known as the ""Atash-kadeh"" آتشکده, is a castle located on the slopes of the mountain on which Dezh Dokhtar is situated. Built in AD 224 by King Ardashir I of the Sassanian Empire, it is located two kilometers (1.2 miles) north of the ancient city of ""Gor"", i.e. the old city of Piruz-Apad in Pars, in ancient Persia (Iran)."
H1,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,Description
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,"The structure contains three domes, among other features, making it slightly larger and more magnificent than its predecessor, the nearby castle of Dezh Dokhtar. However, it seems that the compound was designed to display the royalty image of Ardashir I, rather than being a fortified structure for defense purposes. That is why perhaps it would be best to refer to the structure as a ""palace"" rather than a ""castle"", even though it has huge walls on the perimeters (twice as thick as Ghal'eh Dokhtar), and is a contained structure. From the architectural design, it seems the palace was more of a place of social gathering where guests would be introduced to the imperial throne."
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,What is particularly interesting about this palace is that its architectural design does not exactly fall into that of the Parthians or even Sassanian category; the design is a unique design particular to architects of Fars.
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,"The palace was built next to a picturesque pond that was fed by a natural spring, perhaps in connection with the Persian goddess of water and growth, Anahita. The spring is thought to have fed a royal garden, in the same way that Cyrus had his garden (bustan) built at Pasargadae. The pond was tiled on its sides, surrounded by pavement for guests of the royal court to enjoy the evenings by."
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,"The structure is 104 m (340 ft) by 55 m (180 ft). The iwan is 18 m (60 ft) high, although it has partially collapsed. The structure was built of local rocks and mortar with plasterwork on the insides. The style of the interior design is comparable to that of Tachara palace at Persepolis."
H1,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,History
H1,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,In modern times
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,"Jane Dieulafoy visited the site with her husband, Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy, and described it in ""La Perse, la Chaldée et la Susiane""."
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,"Robert Byron was there in February 1934, and wrote about his visit in ""The Road to Oxiana"". Byron considered the Palace to include the prototype of the squinch. In his view, buildings such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Taj Mahal would not have existed without the squinch and the pendentive."
PA,1487895-Palace-of-Ardashir,Iran has tentatively listed the Palace of Ardashir and other sites in and around Firouzabad as a possible UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.

PA,13081513-Weidenbach--Vulkaneifel,"On 17 October 1016, Weidenbach had its first documentary mention under the name ""Witenbuoch"" in a document from Emperor Heinrich II in which he confirmed to Abbot of Prüm Urold holdings in Weidenbach (""Witenbuoch""), Stadtfeld (""Stadefelt"") and Ließem (""Liudesheim""). The holdings served to support the collegiate church at Prüm that Urold endowed that same year."
PA,13081513-Weidenbach--Vulkaneifel,"Centuries later, the Lords of Pyrmont were enfeoffed with, among other holdings, Weidenbach by Archbishop of Trier Johann II in 1457. In 1460, the Archbishop also took Weidenbach under his protection. In 1565, Count Diedrich I of Manderscheid-Kayl was enfeoffed with Weidenbach."
PA,13081513-Weidenbach--Vulkaneifel,"In 1794, just before the French Revolutionary Wars, Weidenbach belonged to the court district of Ober-Stadtfeld in the ""Amt"" of Manderscheid. The lordship was held by the collegiate foundation B. M. V.

PA,13081513-Weidenbach--Vulkaneifel,"When the French overran the Eifel and other lands on the Rhine’s left bank soon afterwards, the inhabitants of Weidenbach were asked to sign a resolution of unity with the French. Of the 147 people who lived in Weidenbach at the time, nineteen refused to sign."

It is located in downtown Winnipeg where Portage Avenue (Route 85) and Main Street (Route 52) intersect. The corner is well-known across Canada as the ""crossroads of Canada"", due to its relative proximity to the longitudinal centre of Canada."
H1,1465129-Portage-and-Main,History
PA,1465129-Portage-and-Main,"The land upon which Portage and Main sits was originally purchased by Henry McKenney on 2 June 1862. He chose land where the north-south and east-west ox cart paths crossed, in order to build a general store with his half-brother John Christian Schultz."
PA,1465129-Portage-and-Main,"Portage and Main is now the hub of some of Winnipeg's main transportation routes. It was once the centre for the banking industry in Western Canada. The national banks have branches accessible from beneath Portage and Main. It has served as a temporary city square and meeting place for parades and events, including the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919."
PA,1465129-Portage-and-Main,"In 1974, the intersection was featured on an 8-cent stamp."
PA,1465129-Portage-and-Main,"In 1976, the City of Winnipeg signed an agreement with private developers to open an underground concourse linking shopping malls under the four corner properties. This included a 40-year deal to permanently close the pedestrian crossings at the intersection, which street works were completed around 1978. With that deal set to expire, city officials are negotiating an early re-opening of the intersection to pedestrians. The concourse and walkways are currently connected through the Winnipeg Skywalk. The Portage and Main Circus houses a concrete sculptural wall created by Bruce Head."

The long-standing cold weather legend is unproven, because there are no official temperature measurements at any street corner in Canada to confirm the coldest intersection. Winnipeg's city centre is usually 3–4 °C warmer than the airport, owing to the urban heat island effect."

PA,1262-Argot,"An argot (; from French ""argot"" 'slang') is a secret language used by various groups—e.g., schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, gay people (Polari) among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term ""argot"" is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which sense it overlaps with jargon. The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and ""technical colloquialisms""."
PA,1262-Argot,"Author Victor Hugo was one of the first to research and compile terms from criminal argot. In his 1862 novel ""Les Misérables,"" he refers to that argot as both ""the language of the dark"" and ""the language of misery."""
PA,1262-Argot,"The earliest known record of the term ""argot"" in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name ""les argotiers"", given to a group of thieves at that time."
PA,1262-Argot,"Under the strictest definition, an ""argot"" is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ""argot"" used in this sense is synonymous with ""cant"". For example, ""argot"" in this sense is used for systems such as ""verlan"" and ""louchébem"", which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words). Such systems are examples of ""argots à clef"", or ""coded argots."""
PA,1262-Argot,"Specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. For example, modern French ""loufoque"" 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the ""louchébem"" transformation of Fr. ""fou"" 'crazy'."

TI,145295-Wilfrid,Wilfrid
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid (c. 633 – c. 709) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"After becoming Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, Theodore of Tarsus resolved the situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the liturgy. However his diocese was very large, and Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking up some of the larger dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore took the opportunity to implement his reforms despite Wilfrid's objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope Agatho ruled in Wilfrid's favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid spent the next few years in Selsey, where he founded an episcopal see and converted the pagan inhabitants of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity. Theodore and Wilfrid settled their differences, and Theodore urged the new Northumbrian king, Aldfrith, to allow Wilfrid's return. Aldfrith agreed to do so, but in 691 he expelled Wilfrid again. Wilfrid went to Mercia, where he helped missionaries and acted as bishop for the Mercian king. Wilfrid appealed to the papacy about his expulsion in 700, and the pope ordered that an English council should be held to decide the issue. This council, held at Austerfield in 702, attempted to confiscate all of Wilfrid's possessions, and so Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal against the decision. His opponents in Northumbria excommunicated him, but the papacy upheld Wilfrid's side, and he regained possession of Ripon and Hexham, his Northumbrian monasteries. Wilfrid died in 709 or 710. After his death, he was venerated as a saint."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Historians then and now have been divided over Wilfrid. His followers commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" (or ""Life of Saint Wilfrid"") shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled a large number of monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the ""Rule of Saint Benedict"" into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Background
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"During Wilfrid's lifetime Britain and Ireland consisted of a number of small kingdoms. Traditionally the English people were thought to have been divided into seven kingdoms, but modern historiography has shown that this is a simplification of a much more confused situation. A late 7th-century source, the Tribal Hidage, lists the peoples south of the Humber river; among the largest groups of peoples are the West Saxons (later Wessex), the East Angles and Mercians (later the Kingdom of Mercia), and the Kingdom of Kent. Smaller groups who at that time had their own royalty but were later absorbed into larger kingdoms include the peoples of Magonsæte, Lindsey, Hwicce, the East Saxons, the South Saxons, the Isle of Wight, and the Middle Angles. Other even smaller groups had their own rulers, but their size means that they do not often appear in the histories. There were also native Britons in the west, in modern-day Wales and Cornwall, who formed kingdoms including those of Dumnonia, Dyfed, and Gwynedd."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Between the Humber and Forth the English had formed into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, including Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived as an independent power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east a small number of Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts with the rest of the British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Christianity had only recently arrived in some of these kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Sources
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"The main sources for knowledge of Wilfrid are the medieval ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"", written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and the works of the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's ""Vita"" is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The ""Vita"" is selective in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the ""Vita"" is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives, as was the case with Stephen's work. It appears that the ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Bede also covers Wilfrid's life in his ""Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum"", but this account is more measured and restrained than the ""Vita"". In the ""Historia"", Bede used Stephen's ""Vita"" as a source, reworking the information and adding new material when possible. Other, more minor, sources for Wilfrid's life include a mention of Wilfrid in one of Bede's letters. A poetical ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" by Frithegod written in the 10th century is essentially a rewrite of Stephen's ""Vita"", produced in celebration of the movement of Wilfrid's relics to Canterbury. Wilfrid is also mentioned in the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", but as the ""Chronicle"" was probably a 9th-century compilation, the material on Wilfrid may ultimately have derived either from Stephen's ""Vita"" or from Bede. Another, later, source is the ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" written by Eadmer, a 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer and monk from Canterbury. This source is highly influenced by the contemporary concerns of its writer, but does attempt to provide some new material besides reworking Bede."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Many historians, including the editor of Bede's works, Charles Plummer, have seen in Bede's writings a dislike of Wilfrid. The historian Walter Goffart goes further, suggesting that Bede wrote his ""Historia"" as a reaction to Stephen's ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"", and that Stephen's work was written as part of a propaganda campaign to defend a ""Wilfridian"" party in Northumbrian politics. Some historians, including James Fraser, find that a credible view, but others such as Nick Higham are less convinced of Bede's hostility to Wilfrid."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Early life
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Childhood and early education
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was born in Northumbria in about 633. James Fraser argues that Wilfrid's family were aristocrats from Deira, pointing out that most of Wilfrid's early contacts were from that area. A conflict with his stepmother when he was about 14 years old drove Wilfrid to leave home, probably without his father's consent. Wilfrid's background is never explicitly described as noble, but the king's retainers were frequent guests at his father's house, and on leaving home Wilfrid equipped his party with horses and clothes fit for a royal court."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Queen Eanflæd became Wilfrid's patroness following his arrival at the court of her husband, King Oswiu. She sent him to study under Cudda, formerly one of her husband's retainers, but by that time in about 648 a monk on the island of Lindisfarne. The monastery on the island had recently been founded by Aidan, who had been instrumental in converting Northumbria to Christianity. At Lindisfarne Wilfrid is said to have ""learned the whole Psalter by heart and several books"". Wilfrid studied at Lindisfarne for a few years before going to the Kentish king's court at Canterbury in 652, where he stayed with relatives of Queen Eanflæd. The queen had given Wilfrid a letter of introduction to pass to her cousin, King Eorcenberht, in order to ensure that Wilfrid was received by the king. While in Kent, Wilfrid's career was advanced by Eanflæd's cousin Hlothere, who was later the King of Kent from 673 to 685. The Kentish court included a number of visiting clergymen at that time, including Benedict Biscop, a noted missionary. Wilfrid appears to have spent about a year in Kent, but the exact chronology is uncertain."
LI,145295-Wilfrid,Time at Rome and Lyon
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid left Kent for Rome in the company of Benedict Biscop, another of Eanflæd's contacts. This is the first pilgrimage to Rome known to have been undertaken by English natives, and took place some time between 653 and 658. According to Wilfrid's later biographer, Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid left Biscop's company at Lyon, where Wilfrid stayed under the patronage of Annemund, the archbishop. Stephen says that Annemund wanted to marry Wilfrid to the archbishop's niece, and to make Wilfrid the governor of a Frankish province, but that Wilfrid refused and continued on his journey to Rome. There he learned the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter, and studied the Roman practice of relic collecting. He developed a close friendship with Boniface Consiliarius during his time in Rome. After an audience with the pope, Wilfrid returned to Lyon."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Stephen of Ripon says that Wilfrid stayed in Lyon for three years, leaving only after the archbishop's murder. However, Annemund's murder took place in 660 and Wilfrid returned to England in 658, suggesting that Stephen's chronology is awry. Stephen says that Annemund gave Wilfrid a clerical tonsure, although this does not appear to mean that he became a monk, merely that he entered the clergy. Bede is silent on the subject of Wilfrid's monastic status, although Wilfrid probably became a monk during his time in Rome, or afterwards while he was in Gaul. Some historians, however, believe that Wilfrid was never a monk. While in Gaul, Wilfrid absorbed Frankish ecclesiastical practices, including some aspects from the monasteries founded by Columbanus. This influence may be seen in Wilfrid's probable adoption of a Frankish ceremony in his consecration of churches later in his life, as well as in his employment of Frankish masons to build his churches. Wilfrid would also have learned of the ""Rule of Saint Benedict"" in Gaul, as Columbanus' monasteries followed that monastic rule."
TI,145295-Wilfrid,Abbot of Ripon
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"After Wilfrid's return to Northumbria in about 658, Cenwalh, King of Wessex, recommended Wilfrid to Alhfrith, Oswiu's son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy. Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father's rule, and the most likely heir to his father's throne as his half-brothers were still young. Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, formed around a group of monks from Melrose Abbey, followers of the Irish monastic customs. Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs; Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled. Wilfrid introduced the ""Rule of Saint Benedict"" into Ripon, claiming that he was the first person in England to make a monastery follow it, but this claim rests on the ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" and does not say where Wilfrid became knowledgeable about the ""Rule"", nor exactly what form of the ""Rule"" was being referred to. Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by Agilbert, Bishop of Dorchester in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex. Wilfrid was a protégé of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop. The monk Ceolfrith was attracted to Ripon from Gilling Abbey, which had recently been depopulated as a result of the plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there. Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow."
TI,145295-Wilfrid,Whitby
LI,145295-Wilfrid,Background to Whitby
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"The Roman churches and those in Britain and Ireland (often called ""Celtic"" churches) used different methods to calculate the date of Easter. The church in Northumbria had traditionally used the Celtic method, and that was the date observed by King Oswiu. His wife Eanflæd and a son, Alhfrith, celebrated Easter on the Roman date however, which meant that while one part of the royal court was still observing the Lenten fast, another would be celebrating with feasting."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Oswiu called a church council held at Whitby Abbey in 664 in an attempt to resolve this controversy. Although Oswiu himself had been brought up in the ""Celtic"" tradition, political pressures may have influenced his decision to call a council, as well as fears that if dissent over the date of Easter continued in the Northumbrian church it could lead to internal strife. The historian Richard Abels speculates that the expulsion of Eata from Ripon may have been the spark that led to the king's decision to call the council. Regional tensions within Northumbria between the two traditional divisions, Bernicia and Deira, appear to have played a part, as churchmen in Bernicia favoured the Celtic method of dating and those in Deira may have leaned towards the Roman method. Abels identifies several conflicts contributing to both the calling of the council and its outcome, including a generational conflict between Oswiu and Alhfrith and the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Deusdedit. Political concerns unrelated to the dating problem, such as the decline of Oswiu's preeminence among the other English kingdoms and the challenge to that position by Mercia, were also factors."
TI,145295-Wilfrid,Synod
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid attended the synod, or council, of Whitby, as a member of the party favouring the continental practice of dating Easter, along with James the Deacon, Agilbert, and Alhfrith. Those supporting the ""Celtic"" viewpoint were King Oswiu, Hilda, the Abbess of Whitby, Cedd, a bishop, and Colmán of Lindisfarne, the Bishop of Lindisfarne."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was chosen to present the Roman position to the council; he also acted as Agilbert's interpreter, as the latter did not speak the local language. Bede describes Wilfrid as saying that those who did not calculate the date of Easter according to the Roman system were committing a sin. Wilfrid's speech in favour of adopting Roman church practices helped secure the eclipse of the ""Celtic"" party in 664, although most Irish churches did not adopt the Roman date of Easter until 704, and Iona held out until 716. Many of the Irish monasteries did not observe the Roman Easter, but they were not isolated from the continent; by the time of Whitby the southern Irish were already observing the Roman Easter date, and Irish clergy were in contact with their continental counterparts. Those monks and clergy unable to accept the Whitby decision left Northumbria, some going to Ireland and others to Iona."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,York
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Elevation to the episcopate
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"After the supporters of the Celtic dating had withdrawn following the Council of Whitby, Wilfrid became the most prominent Northumbrian cleric. As a result, and because of his performance at Whitby, Wilfrid was elected to a bishopric in Northumbria about a year after the council. It is unclear where his diocese was located, although he was considered to be Alhfrith's bishop. The ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" states that, nominated by both Oswiu and Alhfrith, he was made bishop at York, and that he was a metropolitan bishop, but York at that time was not a Metropolitan Diocese. Bede says that Alhfrith alone nominated Wilfrid, and that Oswiu subsequently proposed an alternative candidate, ""imitating the actions of his son"". Several theories have been suggested to explain the discrepancies between the two sources. One is that Alhfrith wished the seat to be at York, another is that Wilfrid was bishop only in Deira, a third supposes that Wilfrid was never bishop at York and that his diocese was only part of Deira. However, at that time the Anglo-Saxon dioceses were not strictly speaking geographical designations, rather they were bishoprics for the tribes or peoples."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid refused to be consecrated in Northumbria at the hands of Anglo-Saxon bishops. Deusdedit had died shortly after Whitby, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid considered to have been validly consecrated he travelled to Compiègne, to be consecrated by Agilbert, the Bishop of Paris. During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was exposed to a higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example of which is that he was carried to his consecration ceremony on a throne supported by nine bishops."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Delays and difficulties
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid delayed his return from Gaul, only to find on his arrival back in Northumbria that Ceadda had been installed as bishop in his place. The reason for Wilfrid's delay has never been clear, although the historians Eric John and Richard Abels theorise that it was caused by Alhfrith's unsuccessful revolt against Oswiu. They suggest that the rebellion happened shortly after Whitby, perhaps while Wilfrid was in Gaul for his consecration. Because Oswiu knew that Alhfrith had been a supporter of Wilfrid's, Oswiu prevented Wilfrid's return, suspecting Wilfrid of supporting his rivals. That Ceadda was supported by Oswiu, and Wilfrid had been a supporter of Oswiu's son, lends further credence to the theory that Alhfrith's rebellion took place while Wilfrid was in Gaul. Stephen of Ripon reported that Wilfrid was expelled by ""Quartodecimans"", or those who supported the celebration of Easter on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan, whether or not this was a Sunday. However, as the Irish church had never been Quartodecimans, Stephen in this instance was constructing a narrative to put Wilfrid in the best light."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"During his return to Northumbria Wilfrid's ship was blown ashore on the Sussex coast, the inhabitants of which were at that time pagan. On being attacked by the locals, Wilfrid's party killed the head priest before refloating their ship and making their escape. The historian Marion Gibbs suggests that after this episode Wilfrid visited Kent again, and took part in the diplomacy related to Wigheard's appointment to the see of Canterbury. Wilfrid may also have taken part in negotiations to persuade King Cenwalh of Wessex to allow Agilbert to return to his see."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Favourable outcome
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid spent the three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon. He occasionally performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river Humber. The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid may not have been allowed to return to Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court, but most historians have argued that Wilfrid was at Ripon."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid's monasteries in Mercia may date from this time, as King Wulfhere of Mercia gave him large grants of land in Mercia. Wilfrid may have persuaded King Ecgberht of Kent in 669 to build a church in an abandoned Roman fort at Reculver. When Theodore, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, arrived in England in 669 it was clear that something had to be done about the situation in Northumbria. Ceadda's election to York was improper, and Theodore did not consider Ceadda's consecration to have been valid. Consequently, Theodore deposed Ceadda, leaving the way open for Wilfrid, who was finally installed in his see in 669, the first Saxon to occupy the see of York. Wilfrid spent the next nine years building churches, including at the monastery at Hexham, and attending to diocesan business. He continued to exercise control over his monastic houses of Ripon and Hexham while he was bishop. Oswiu's death on 15 February 670 eliminated a source of friction and helped to assure Wilfrid's return."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"While at York, Wilfrid was considered the ""bishop of the Northumbrian peoples""; Bede records that Wilfrid's diocese was contiguous with the area ruled by Oswiu. The diocese was restricted to north of the Humber, however. Wilfrid may also have sought to exercise some ecclesiastical functions in the Pictish kingdom, as he is accorded the title ""bishop of the Northumbrians and the Picts"" in 669. Further proof of attempted Northumbrian influence in the Pictish regions is provided by the establishment for the Picts in 681 of a diocese centred on Abercorn, in the old territory of the British kingdom of Gododdin. The grants of land to Wilfrid west of the Pennines testify to Northumbrian expansion in that area. The ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" claims that Wilfrid had ecclesiastical rule over Britons and Gaels. In 679, while Wilfrid was in Rome, he claimed authority over ""all the northern part of Britain, Ireland and the islands, which are inhabited by English and British peoples, as well as by Gaelic and Pictish peoples""."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Diocesan affairs
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid did not attend the Council of Hertford held in September 672, but he did send representatives. Among the council's resolutions was one postponing a decision on the creation of new dioceses, which affected Wilfrid later. Another ruling confirmed that the Roman calculation for the date of Easter should be adopted, and that bishops should act only in their own dioceses. During the middle 670s Wilfrid acted as middleman in the negotiations to return a Merovingian prince, Dagobert II, from his exile in Ireland to Gaul. Wilfrid was one of the first churchmen in Northumbria to utilise written charters as records of gifts to his churches. He ordered the creation of a listing of all benefactions received by Ripon, which was recited at the dedication ceremony."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was an advocate for the use of music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"", which has led to the assumption that the ""Vita"" was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the ""Vita"" was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid in the last years of Wilfrid's life, not a close companion."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid introduced the ""Rule of Saint Benedict"" into the monasteries he founded. It appears likely that he was the first to introduce the Benedictine Rule into England, as evidence is lacking that Augustine's monastery at Canterbury followed the ""Rule"". He also was one of the first Anglo-Saxon bishops to record the gifts of land and property to his church, which he did at Ripon. Easter tables, used to calculate the correct date to celebrate Easter, were brought in from Rome where the Dionysiac Easter tables had been recently introduced. He set up schools and became a religious advisor to the Northumbrian queen Æthelthryth, first wife of Ecgfrith. Æthelthryth donated the land at Hexham where Wilfrid founded a monastery and built a church using some recycled stones from the Roman town of Corbridge. When Wilfrid arrived in York as bishop the cathedral's roof was on the point of collapse; he had it repaired and covered in lead, and had glass set in the windows."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"The historian Barbara Yorke says of Wilfrid at this time that he ""seems to have continued a campaign against any survival of 'Irish errors' and distrusted any communities that remained in contact with Iona or other Irish religious houses which did not follow the Roman Easter"". He also worked to combat pagan practices, building a church at Melrose on a pagan site. Contemporaries said of him that he was the first native bishop to ""introduce the Catholic way of life to the churches of the English"". He did not neglect his pastoral duties in his diocese, making visits throughout the diocese to baptise and perform other episcopal functions, such as consecrating new churches. Some of the monasteries in his diocese were put under his protection by their abbots or abbesses, who were seeking someone to help protect their endowments. In ruling over such monasteries, Wilfrid may have been influenced by the Irish model of a group of monasteries all ruled by one person, sometimes while holding episcopal office."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was criticised for dressing his household and servants in clothing fit for royalty. He was accompanied on his travels by a retinue of warriors, one of whom, while at York, Wilfrid sent to abduct a young boy who had been promised to the church but whose family had changed their mind. Wilfrid also educated young men, both for clerical and secular careers."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Expulsion
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Dispute with the king
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was expelled from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues that they had been part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Theodore took advantage of the situation to implement decrees of some councils on dividing up large dioceses. Theodore set up new bishoprics from Wilfrid's diocese, with seats at York, Hexham, Lindisfarne, and one in the region of Lindsey. The Lindsey see was quickly absorbed by the Diocese of Lichfield, but the other three remained separate. The bishops chosen for these sees, Eata at Hexham, Eadhæd at Lindsey, and Bosa at York, had all either been supporters of the ""Celtic"" party at Whitby, or been trained by those who were. Eata had also been ejected from Ripon by Wilfrid. The new bishops were unacceptable to Wilfrid, who claimed they were not truly members of the Church because of their support for the ""Celtic"" method of dating Easter, and thus he could not serve alongside them. Another possible problem for Wilfrid was that the three new bishops did not come from Wilfrid's monastic houses nor from the communities where the bishops' seats were based. This was contrary to the custom of the time, which was to promote bishoprics from within the locality. Wilfrid's deposition became tangled up in a dispute over whether or not the Gregorian plan for Britain, with two metropolitan sees, the northern one set at York, would be followed through or abandoned. Wilfrid seems to have felt that he had metropolitan authority over the northern part of England, but Theodore never acknowledged that claim, instead claiming authority over the whole of the island of Britain."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Appeal to Rome
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid went to Rome after his expulsion to appeal against Theodore and Ecgfrith's decisions, the first Englishman to challenge a royal or ecclesiastical decision by petitioning the papacy. On the way he stopped at the court of Aldgisl, the Frisian king in Utrecht for most of 678. Wilfrid had been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, and ended up in Frisia according to some historians. Others state that he intended to journey via Frisia to avoid Neustria, whose Mayor of the Palace, Ebroin, disliked Wilfrid. He wintered in Frisia, avoiding the diplomatic efforts of Ebroin, who according to Stephen attempted to have Wilfrid killed. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid's biographer says that most of the nobles converted, but the success was short-lived. After Frisia, he stopped at the court of Dagobert II in Austrasia, where the king offered Wilfrid the Bishopric of Strasbourg, which Wilfrid refused. Once in Italy, Wilfrid was received by Perctarit, a Lombard king, who gave him a place at his court."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Pope Agatho held a synod in October 679, which although it ordered Wilfrid's restoration and the return of the monasteries to his control, also directed that the new dioceses should be retained. Wilfrid was, however, given the right to replace any bishop in the new dioceses to whom he objected. The council had been called to deal with the Monothelete controversy, and Wilfrid's concerns were not the sole focus of the council. In fact, the historian Henry Chadwick thought that one reason Wilfrid secured the mostly favourable outcome was that Agatho wished for Wilfrid's support and testimony that the English Church was free of the monothelete heresy. Although Wilfrid did not win a complete victory, he did secure a papal decree limiting the number of dioceses in England to 12. Wilfrid also secured the right for his monasteries of Ripon and Hexham to be directly supervised by the pope, preventing any further interference in their affairs by the diocesan bishops."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid returned to England after the council via Gaul. According to Stephen of Ripon, after the death of Dagobert II, Ebroin wished to imprison Wilfrid, but Wilfrid miraculously escaped. In 680 Wilfrid returned to Northumbria and appeared before a royal council. He produced the papal decree ordering his restoration, but was instead briefly imprisoned and then exiled by the king. Wilfrid stayed for a short time in the kingdom of the Middle Angles and at Wessex, but soon took refuge in Sussex with King Æthelwealh of Sussex."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Missions in Sussex
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid spent the next five years preaching to, and converting the pagan inhabitants of Sussex, the South Saxons. He also founded Selsey Abbey, on an estate near Selsey of 87 hides, given to Wilfrid by Æthelwealh, king of the South Saxons. Bede attributes Wilfrid's ability to convert the South Saxons to his teaching them how to fish, and contrasts it with the lack of success of the Irish monk Dicuill. Bede also says that the Sussex area had been experiencing a drought for three years before Wilfrid's arrival, but miraculously when Wilfrid arrived, and started baptising converts, rain began to fall. Wilfrid worked with Bishop Erkenwald of London, helping to set up the church in Sussex. Erkenwald also helped reconcile Wilfrid and Theodore before Theodore's death in 690. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh died during an invasion of his kingdom by Cædwalla of Wessex. Wilfrid previously had contact with Cædwalla, and may have served as his spiritual advisor before Cædwalla's invasion of Sussex. After Æthelwealh's death and Cædwalla's accession to the throne of Wessex, Wilfrid became one of the new king's advisors, and the king was converted. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh's grant of land in the Selsey area and Wilfrid built his cathedral church near the entrance to Pagham Harbour, believed to be what is now Church Norton."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Cædwalla sent Wilfrid to the Isle of Wight, which was still pagan, with the aim of converting the inhabitants. The king also gave Wilfrid a quarter of the land on the island as a gift. In 688, the king relinquished his throne and went on a pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised, but died shortly after the ceremony. Wilfrid was probably influential in Cædwalla's decision to be baptised in Rome."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"During his time in Sussex Wilfrid was reconciled with Archbishop Theodore; the ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid may have been involved in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Return to Northumbria and exile
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Return from exile
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"In 686 Wilfrid was recalled to Northumbria after the death of Ecgfrith in battle with the Picts. During the 680s Theodore had created two more dioceses in Northumbria, at Ripon, and at Abercorn in the Pictish kingdom, but both were short-lived. After Ecgfrith's death, Theodore wrote to the new king of Northumbria, Aldfrith, and to Æthelred, king of Mercia and the Abbess of Whitby, Ælfflæd, suggesting that an agreement be made allowing Wilfrid's return to Northumbria. Aldfrith agreed, Wilfrid returned to the north, and Bosa was removed from York. Wilfrid did not recover the whole of his previous bishopric however, as Hexham and Lindisfarne remained separate sees."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid appears to have lived at Ripon, and for a time he acted as administrator of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert's death in 687. In 691, the subdivision issue arose once more, along with quarrels with King Aldfrith over lands, and attempts were made to make Wilfrid either give up all his lands or to stay confined to Ripon. A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source of dispute. When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Something of the reception to Wilfrid's expulsion can be picked up in a Latin letter which has survived only in an incomplete quotation by William of Malmesbury in his ""Gesta pontificum Anglorum"". We have it on William's authority that the letter was written by Aldhelm of Malmesbury and addressed to Wilfrid's abbots. In it, Aldhelm asks the clergymen to remember the exiled bishop ""who, nourishing, teaching, reproving, raised you in fatherly love"" and appealing to lay aristocratic ideals of loyalty, urges them not to abandon their superior. Neither William nor the citation itself gives a date, but the letter has been assigned to Wilfrid's exile under Aldfrith in the 690s."
H2,145295-Wilfrid,Mercia
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"During his stay in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop with the consent of King Æthelred. Information on Wilfrid's life at this time is meagre, as the ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" says little of this period. He is generally considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham. Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the Frisians, which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more successful than his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was present at the exhumation of the body of Queen Æthelthryth at Ely Abbey in 695. He had been her spiritual adviser in the 670s, and had helped the queen become a nun against the wishes of her husband King Ecgfrith of Northumbria. The queen had joined Ely Abbey, where she died in 679. The ceremony in 695 found that her body had not decayed, which led to her being declared a saint. Wilfrid's testimony as to the character and virginity of Æthelthryth was recorded by Bede."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"In about 700, Wilfrid appealed once more to Pope Sergius I over his expulsion from York, and the pope referred the issue back to a council in England. In 702 King Aldfrith held a council at Austerfield that upheld Wilfrid's expulsion, and once more Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the pope. The ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" gives a speech, supposedly delivered by Wilfrid there, in defence of Wilfrid's record over the previous 40 years. The council was presided over by Berhtwald, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and the decision of the council was that Wilfrid should be deprived of all his monasteries but Ripon, and that he should cease to perform episcopal functions. When Wilfrid continued his appeal to the papacy, his opponents had him and his supporters excommunicated."
LI,145295-Wilfrid,Rome and final return to Northumbria
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"On his way to Rome Wilfrid stopped in Frisia to visit Willibrord. Following Wilfrid's arrival in Rome the pope held a council, which declared that the King of Northumbria should follow the earlier papal decrees restoring Wilfrid to his see. Wilfrid was disconcerted to find that the papal court spoke Greek, and his biographer noted that Wilfrid was displeased when the pope discussed the appeal with advisers in a language Wilfrid could not understand. The pope also ordered another council to be held in Britain to decide the issue, and ordered the attendance of Bosa, Berhtwald and Wilfrid. On his journey back to England Wilfrid had a seizure at Meaux, but he had returned to Kent by 705."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Aldfrith died soon after Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been considered one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid to stay out of Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign lasted only a few months however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid may have been one of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John's transfer from Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Other aspects
TI,145295-Wilfrid,Cult of St Oswald
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Sometime after the translation of the relics of Oswald of Northumbria to Bardney Abbey by Osthryth between 675 and 679, Wilfrid, along with Hexham Abbey, began to encourage and promote the cult of the dead king. Barbara Yorke sees this advocacy as a major factor in the prominence given to Oswald in Bede's ""Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum"". Historian D. P. Kirby regards Wilfrid's championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid's expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald's branch of the Northumbrian royal family over his own. One of Wilfrid's protégés, Willibrord, became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid's example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid's followers."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Monastic network
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid's network of monasteries extended across at least three of the kingdoms of England in his day. They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120 followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated that one reason for Wilfrid's exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was a prolific founder of churches, which he then controlled until his death, and was a great fundraiser, acquiring lands and money from many of the kings he was in contact with. He was also noted for his ability to attract support from powerful women, especially queens. Queen Eanflæd, his first patron, introduced him to a number of helpful contacts, and he later attracted the support of Queen Æthelthryth, who gave the endowment for Hexham Abbey. Ælfflæd, sister of King Aldfrith of Northumbria and daughter of Wilfrid's old patron Queen Eanflæd, helped to persuade the Northumbrians to allow Wilfrid to return from his last exile."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Builder and artistic patron
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid built a church capable of accommodating a congregation of 2,000 at Hexham, using stone from Hadrian's Wall. The 12th-century writer Ailred of Rievaulx, whose family helped restore Hexham, credited Wilfrid as the designer of a church beautifully embellished with paintings and sculpture. It appears that the churches at Hexham and Ripon (which Wilfrid also built) were aisled basilicas, of the type that was common on the continent. Ripon was the first church in Northumbria to incorporate a ""porticus"", similar to those of churches in Kent. 12th-century pilgrims' accounts declared that the church at Hexham rivalled those of Rome. The crypts at both Ripon and Hexham are unusual, and perhaps were intended by Wilfrid to mimic the Roman catacombs which he had seen on his travels. They are still extant, although the fabric of Wilfrid's churches above ground has been replaced by later structures. The churches were finished with glazed windows, made by glassmakers brought over from the continent."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"As well as his building projects Wilfrid also commissioned works to embellish the churches, including altar cloths made of silk woven with gold threads, and a gospel book written on parchment dyed purple, with gold lettering. The gospels were then enclosed in a gold book cover set with gems. When the church he had built at Ripon was consecrated, a three-day feast was held to accompany the ceremony."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Resignation and death
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"After his final return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at Ripon, where he lived until his death during a visit to Oundle, at the age of 75. A little over a year before his death in either 709 or 710 Wilfrid suffered another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for the disposition of his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near the altar of his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb. Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protégé who had accompanied him to Rome in 703. The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid's death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and a spectacular white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid left large sums of money to his monastic foundations, enabling them to purchase royal favour. Soon after his death a ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"", was written by Stephen of Ripon, a monk of Ripon. The first version appeared in about 715 followed by a later revision in the 730s, the first biography written by a contemporary to appear in England. It was commissioned by two of Wilfrid's followers, Acca of Hexham, and the Abbot of Ripon, Tatbert. Stephen's ""Vita"" is concerned with vindicating Wilfrid and making a case for his sainthood, and so is used with caution by historians, although it is nevertheless an invaluable source for Wilfrid's life and the history of the time."
H1,145295-Wilfrid,Legacy
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were celebrated in early medieval England, but the April date appeared first in the liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened at the spot where the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's ""Vita Sancti Oswaldi"", or ""Life of Saint Oswald"", Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"After the Norman Conquest of England, devotion continued to be paid to Wilfrid, with 48 churches dedicated to him and relics distributed between 11 sites. During the 19th century, the feast of Wilfrid was celebrated on the Sunday following Lammas in the town of Ripon with a parade and horse racing, a tradition which continued until at least 1908. Wilfrid is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion. He is usually depicted either as a bishop preaching and baptising or else as a robed bishop holding an episcopal staff."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"Wilfrid was one of the first bishops to bring relics of saints back from Rome. The papacy was trying to prevent the removal of actual body parts from Rome, restricting collectors to things that had come in contact with the bodily remains such as dust and cloth. Wilfrid was known as an advocate of Benedictine monasticism, and regarded it as a tool in his efforts to ""root out the poisonous weeds planted by the Scots"". He built at Ripon and Hexham, and lived a majestic lifestyle. As a result of his various exiles, he founded monastic communities that were widely scattered over the British Isles, over which he kept control until his death. These monastic foundations, especially Hexham, contributed to the blending of the Gaelic and Roman strains of Christianity in Northumbria, which inspired a great surge of learning and missionary activity; Bede and Alcuin were among the scholars who emerged from Northumbrian monasteries influenced by Wilfrid. Missionaries inspired by his example went from Northumbria to the continent, where they converted pagans in Germany and elsewhere."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"One commentator has said that Wilfrid ""came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age"". Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that ""Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility"". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that ""Wilfrid's character was such that he seems to have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure"". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback."
PA,145295-Wilfrid,"The historian Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: ""Wilfrid left a distinctive mark on the character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, was he a man greatly interested in learning, and perhaps he would have been more at home as a member of the Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison."" R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was ""the greatest papal enthusiast of the century"". James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him ""He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman."""

LI,1904897-Special-edition,Special edition
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"The terms special edition, limited edition, and variants such as deluxe edition, or collector's edition, are used as a marketing incentive for various kinds of products, originally published products related to the arts, such as books, prints, video games or recorded music and films, but now including clothing, cars, fine wine, and whisky, among other products. A limited edition is restricted in the number of copies produced, although in fact the number may be very low or very high. A special edition implies there is extra material of some kind included. The term is frequently used on DVD film releases, often when the so-called ""special"" edition is actually the only version released."
LI,1904897-Special-edition,Collector's edition
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"Collector's edition may just be another term for special edition. It may also refer to books in special limited and numbered editions, sometimes hand-bound, and signed by the artist and containing one or more original works or prints produced directly from their work and printed under their supervision."
H1,1904897-Special-edition,Disc products
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"Popular culture widely employs ""Special, Deluxe, Expanded and Limited Edition"" in marketing, releasing subsequent, improved versions of film DVDs, music, and video games. Companies widely use special editions and incremental improvements to sell the same products to consumers multiple times. This has been seen in the ""10th Anniversary edition"" of ""Titanic"", which simply consists of the first two discs of the previous ""Special Collector's edition"", only with new packaging, and on CD with the ""30 Year Anniversary Edition"" of Bob Marley's ""Exodus"", which has exactly the same content as the original album, but in new packaging."
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"In many cases, successful film releases have had items made in limited numbers. These ""limited editions"" usually contain the best DVD edition possible of a film with special items in a box set, sometimes containing items available only in the limited edition. Items marked thus are often (but not always) released for a shorter time and in lower quantity than common editions, often with a running number (e.g. ""13055 of 20000"") printed on the products to boost the rarity feel, as the company implies not to manufacture more. It is also common to have such items packaged with unique designs."
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"With the success of DVDs, special editions of films themselves (instead of just special editions of film DVDs) have also become fairly common. Sharing similarities with the concept of a director's cut (another long-suffering inflation-by-marketing term). These generally feature additional in-movie material. The material may be footage originally deleted from the final cut, or new digitally-created, interpolated content. Unlike true director's cuts, the directors may not have had part in such projects, such as in """", in which Richard Donner did not help create the new version, just supply the material. The ""Doctor Who"" television movie ""The Five Doctors"" was edited, recut, amongst various other changes, to make the ""Special Edition"" in 1999 for the first DVD release of the episode."
LI,1904897-Special-edition,Limited edition prints
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"Limited edition prints, also known as LEs, have been standard in printmaking from the nineteenth century onwards. A limit to the print run is crucial, as many traditional printmaking techniques can only produce a limited number of best quality impressions. This can be as few as ten or twenty for a technique like drypoint, but more commonly would be in the low hundreds - print runs of over a thousand are regarded as dubious by the serious art market for original prints, even though with many techniques there is no loss of quality."
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"Edition sizes higher than about 500 are likely to be of print reproductions of paintings, of much less value, though some modern techniques blur this traditional distinction. As in other fields, the use of the concept has become largely driven by marketing imperatives, and has been misused in parts of the market. In particular, lithographic, photogravure, rotogravure, and giclee reproductions of prints, derived from photographs of an original print, which are most unlikely to have any investment value, are often issued in limited editions implying that they will have such value. These need to be distinguished from the original artist's print, carefully produced directly from his work, and printed under the artist's supervision."
H1,1904897-Special-edition,Consumer protection
PA,1904897-Special-edition,In UK and New Zealand the Fine Art Trade Guild ensures the quality and verification of limited edition prints by employing a number of strictly administered regulations for all processes and aspects related to them.
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"In the United States limited editions are regulated under state consumer protections laws. California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the ""California Print Law"" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the ""Georgia Print Law"". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states. The Georgia Print Law written by (former) State Representative Chesley V. Morton, became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to perspective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law. The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished."
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"A limited edition is normally hand signed and numbered by the artist, typically in pencil, in the form (e.g.): 14/100. The first number is the number of the print itself. The second number is the number of overall prints the artist will print of that image. The lower the second number is, the more valuable and collectible the limited editions are likely to be, within whatever their price range is. A small number of ""artists' proofs"" may also be produced as well, signed and with ""AP"", ""proof"", etc. Prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked ""H. C."" or ""H/C"", meaning ""hors de commerce"", not for sale."
H1,1904897-Special-edition,Music
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"In terms of musical albums, the term ""deluxe edition"" refers to a re-release of an album, generally a sufficient period after the initial release, featuring extra content related to the album. From the 2000s it has become commonplace for a deluxe edition to be released at the same time as the standard edition. The deluxe edition often includes some or all of the following: extra tracks; demo recordings of album tracks; live recordings of album tracks; alternate takes, mixes, or edits of album tracks; B-sides from album singles that did not appear on the album; DVD content, including music videos. These editions are commonly repackaged, with the new content on a second disc and many feature additional liner notes."
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"Also, some albums are initially released in two editions, a regular retail version and a ""special"" or ""limited"" version in distinctive packaging and often including extras such as a second disc, a video DVD, or liner notes expanded into a hardback book. Generally, the special package is only produced for the first pressing or a set number of copies - some are limited to only being sold at one chain of retailers. It is important to distinguish this from an expanded re-release, since those are generally available widely and for a long period of time."
TI,1904897-Special-edition,Milking
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"Milking, or ""double-dipping"", refers to the practice of releasing multiple editions of the same product (usually a CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc), simultaneously or at different times, with the purpose of enticing consumers to buy more than one edition. This can be done with, for example, a special edition, a director's cut, an ultimate edition, and a collector's edition, sometimes with different features or supplementary material."
PA,1904897-Special-edition,"The consumer may be persuaded to purchase multiple editions, with the belief that the additional features or content will be worth paying for a product that is largely equivalent to one already owned."

PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"European Distributed Energy Partnership (EU-DEEP) is a large research project supported by the European Union (EU) and coordinated by GDF Suez. Started in 2004, the project gathers 41 organizations around the common objective of removing the main barriers to massive deployment of distributed energy resources (DER)."
H1,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,Background
PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"DER are small grid connecting devices that enable decentralized energy to be stored or generated close to the load they serve with the capacity of 10 megawatts (MW) or less. Centralized power plants use energy to transmit power over long distance, so decentralizing the system uses less energy and encompasses a wide variety of different advancing renewable technologies such as Wind power, Solar power, Geothermal power, Biomass, and Biogas into the system."
PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"“European cities are the most advanced in terms of the transition to new energies”, Denis Simonneau, Head of International and European Relations at GDF SUEZ."
PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"The EU-DEEP project, developed by eight different European energy companies, was designed so that most of the technical and non-technical issues which halt a massive deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) in Europe could be eliminated."
LI,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,Studies related to the project
PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"To address the wide range of challenges associated with operating the electricity system of the future, the leading Transmission system operator(TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs), manufacturers and research establishments in the EU have formed a consortium of 18 partners to undertake a 4-year project code named FENIX whose overall aim is:"

PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"for the future cost efficient, secure and sustainable EU electricity supply system."""
PA,19777853-European-Distributed-Energy-Partnership,"""The main concern is to provide answers to tackle the different types of barrier to DER deployment."" There is three main types of barriers to the DER deployment which are technology barriers, market barriers, and regulatory barriers. Feem was one of the EU-DEEP partner that was responsible for developing Regulatory Models for the integration of DER. Focusing on FEEM's research, they had work on Demand Response. The main point of the work was to show ""how to correlate price patterns to different generation technologies and validation of the three Business Models."""

The original beer brewed, which historically made up 90% of company production, was based on a formula Leinenkugel brought with him from Germany. The company is the oldest operating business in Chippewa Falls."

PA,1728516-Jacob-Leinenkugel-Brewing-Company,"During Prohibition, the company produced near beer (known as ""Leino"") as well as soda water. With the repeal of Prohibition, Jacob Leinenkugel's daughters mortgaged their homes to fund the restoration of the company's beer brewing vats."
PA,1728516-Jacob-Leinenkugel-Brewing-Company,"The Leinenkugel brewery expanded from its local roots beginning in the 1970s, when it first introduced its light beer. The family-owned brewery was sold in 1988 to Philip Morris subsidiary Miller Brewing Company in an effort to stay solvent.

H1,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,Abstract
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"William Henry Bury (25 May 1859 – 24 April 1889) was suspected of being the notorious serial killer ""Jack the Ripper"". He was hanged for the murder of his wife Ellen in 1889, and was the last person executed in Dundee, Scotland."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Bury was orphaned at an early age and was educated at a charitable school in the English Midlands. After a few years in regular employment, he fell into financial difficulty, was dismissed for theft, and became a street peddler. In 1887 he moved to London, where he married Ellen Elliot, who was probably a prostitute. During their stormy marriage, which lasted just over a year, they faced increasing financial hardship. In January 1889, they moved to Dundee. The following month, Bury strangled his wife with a rope, stabbed her dead body with a penknife, and hid the corpse in a box in their room. A few days later, he presented himself to the local police and was arrested for her murder. Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Shortly before his execution, he confessed to the crime. Although Bury's guilt was not in doubt, Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty and ""The Dundee Courier"" printed an editorial the day after his execution decrying the ""judicial butcheries"" of capital punishment."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Bury killed his wife shortly after the height of the London Whitechapel murders, which were attributed to the unidentified serial killer ""Jack the Ripper"". Bury's previous abode near Whitechapel and similarities between the Ripper's crimes and Bury's led the press, as well as executioner James Berry, to suggest that Bury was the Ripper. Bury protested his innocence in the Ripper crimes, and the police discounted him as a suspect. Later authors have built on the earlier accusations, but the idea that Bury was the Ripper is not widely accepted."
H1,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,Childhood and youth
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"William Bury was born in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, the youngest of four children of Henry Bury and his wife Mary Jane (née Henley). He was orphaned in infancy. His father, who worked for a local fishmonger called Joscelyne, died in a horse and cart accident in Halesowen on 10 April 1860. While on an incline, he fell beneath the wheels of his fish cart and was killed when the horse bolted and pulled the cart over his prone body. William's mother may have been suffering from post-natal depression at the time of her husband's death and was committed to the Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum on 7 May 1860 suffering from melancholia. She remained there until her death aged 33 on 30 March 1864."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"William's eldest sibling, Elizabeth Ann, died at the age of seven during an epileptic fit on 7 September 1859, which may have contributed to Mary Jane's depression. The other two children, Joseph Henry and Mary Jane, both died before 1889. William was raised initially in Dudley by his maternal uncle, Edward Henley, and by 1871 he was enrolled at the Blue Coat charity school in Stourbridge."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"At the age of sixteen, he found work as a factor's clerk in a warehouse at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s when he left the warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham."
H1,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,London
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"In October 1887, Bury arrived in Bow, London, and found work selling sawdust for James Martin, who appears to have run a brothel at 80 Quickett Street, Bow. Initially, Bury lived in the stable, but later moved into the house. There, he met Ellen Elliot, who was employed by Martin as a servant and probably a prostitute."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Ellen was born on 24 October 1856 in Walworth, London, at the Bricklayer's Arms public house run by her father, George Elliot. In adult life, she worked as a needlewoman and in a jute processing factory. In 1883, she had an illegitimate daughter, also called Ellen, who died in Poplar workhouse in December 1885. Within a year of the death of her daughter, she began working for Martin. In March 1888, Ellen and William left Martin's employ and moved to a furnished room at 3 Swaton Road, Bow, where they lived together until their marriage on Easter Monday, 2 April 1888, at Bromley Parish Church. Martin later said he had dismissed William because of unpaid debts."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Martin and the landlady at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, described Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days threatening to cut her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With the money from the shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there."
H2,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,Dundee
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"The Burys travelled north as second-class passengers on the steamer ""Cambria"". They arrived at Dundee on the evening of 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"On Monday 4 February, William bought some rope at the local grocer's shop, and spent the rest of the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later reported to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Parr took Bury upstairs to see Lieutenant David Lamb, the head of the detective department. Parr told Lamb, ""This man has a wonderful story to tell you."" Bury retold his story to Lamb, but omitted the reference to Jack the Ripper, and added that he had stabbed his wife's body once. Bury was searched, and a small knife, bankbook and his house key were confiscated pending inquiries. Lamb and Detective Constable Peter Campbell proceeded to the Burys' dingy flat, where they discovered the mutilated remains of Ellen stuffed into the wooden box Bury had commissioned in London."
H1,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,Investigation
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Lamb returned to the police station and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated. A preliminary search of the premises revealed chalk graffiti on the rear door of the flat, which read ""Jack Ripper is at the back of this door"", and on the stairwell leading up from the rear of the property, which read ""Jack Ripper is in this seller "". The press and the police thought they had been written by a local boy before the tragedy, but the writer was never identified. A more extensive search the following morning found blood-stained clothing in the crate that had contained the body, and the remains of more clothing and some of Ellen's personal effects burned in the fireplace. The flat was bereft of furniture, indicating that it may have been burnt on the fire, either for heat or to destroy evidence. A large penknife was found with human flesh and blood upon it, and the rope that William had bought on the morning of 4 February was found with strands of Ellen's hair caught in the fibres."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Ellen's body was examined by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon Henry Littlejohn and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled from behind. Her right leg was broken in two places so it could be crammed into the crate. Incisions, made by the penknife, ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made ""within at most ten minutes of the time of death"" according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn. Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Chief Constable Dewar sent a telegraph detailing the circumstances of the crime to the London Metropolitan Police, which was investigating the crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper. Detectives from London did not consider Bury a realistic suspect in their investigation into the Ripper murders, but Inspector Frederick Abberline did interview witnesses in Whitechapel connected to Bury, including William's former employer James Martin and landlords Elizabeth Haynes and William Smith. According to the executioner James Berry and crime reporter Norman Hastings, Scotland Yard sent two detectives to interview Bury, but there is no surviving record of the visit in the police archive."
H1,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,Trial and execution
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for the murder of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team comprised solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05 p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40 p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"On 1 April, Bury's solicitor, David Tweedie, petitioned the Secretary of State for Scotland, Lord Lothian, for clemency. Tweedie argued that the sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment on the grounds of the conflicting medical evidence and the jury's initial reservations. Tweedie further argued that Bury could have inherited insanity from his mother, who had died in a lunatic asylum. A clergyman whom Bury had befriended, Edward John Gough, minister of St Paul's Episcopalian Church in Dundee, also wrote to Lothian asking for a reprieve. The Secretary of State refused to intervene in the normal course of the law, and Bury was hanged on 24 April by executioner James Berry. The following day, ""The Dundee Courier"" printed an editorial lambasting capital punishment:"
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,It was the last execution held in Dundee.
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"A few days before the execution, Bury confessed to Reverend Gough that he had killed Ellen. At the urging of Gough, William wrote a confession on 22 April 1889, which he asked to be withheld until after he was dead. William claimed that he had strangled Ellen without premeditation on the night of 4 February 1889 during a drunken row over money, and that he had tried to dismember the body for disposal the next day but was too squeamish to continue. The latter part of this confession does not match the expert testimony of the physicians, who said that the incisions were made ""within at most ten minutes of the time of death"" rather than the next day. William stated he had stuffed Ellen's body into the crate as part of a later plan for disposal, but instead concocted the suicide story when he realised that Ellen's absence would be noted."
LI,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,Jack the Ripper suspect
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Traditionally, five murders (known as the ""canonical five"") are attributed to the notorious serial killer ""Jack the Ripper"", who terrorised Whitechapel in the East End of London between August and November 1888. Authorities are not agreed on the exact number of the Ripper's victims, and at least eleven Whitechapel murders between April 1888 and February 1891 were included in the same extensive police investigation. All the crimes remain unsolved."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Claims that Bury could have been the Ripper began to appear in newspapers shortly after Bury's arrest. Like Bury, the Ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths, and Bury lived in Bow, near Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which placed him fairly near the Whitechapel murders at the appropriate time. The ""Dundee Advertiser"" of 12 February claimed that the Burys' ""neighbours were startled and alarmed at the idea that one whom in their terror they associated with the Whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst."" ""The New York Times"" of the same day connected Bury directly to the atrocities and reported the theory that William had murdered Ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt, a story picked up and repeated by ""The Dundee Courier"" the following day. ""The Courier"" alleged that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper, but Parr's version of the story says only that Bury said he was afraid he would be arrested as Jack the Ripper. Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's murder. Nevertheless, the executioner James Berry promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper. Berry did not include Bury or the Ripper in his memoirs, ""My Experiences as an Executioner"", but Ernest A. Parr, a journalist in the Suffolk town of Newmarket, wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry ""told me explicitly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper""."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"In the 1920s, Norman Hastings built on Berry's hypothesis proposing Bury as the Ripper, and 100 years after the Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee librarian Euan Macpherson published books and articles popularising Bury as a Ripper suspect. They highlighted that the canonical five Whitechapel murders ended in November 1888, which roughly coincided with Bury's departure from Whitechapel. There was graffiti at Bury's Dundee flat that implied that Jack the Ripper lived there, and Macpherson supposed this was written by Bury as a form of confession. William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim Annie Chapman. Bury was persistently violent to his wife, threatened her with a knife, and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to the Whitechapel murderer. In a conversation with her neighbours, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop above the Burys' Prince's Street flat in Dundee, asked them ""What sort of work was this you Whitechapel folk have been about, letting Jack the Ripper kill so many people?"" Bury did not answer her, but Ellen replied ""Jack the Ripper is quiet now."" She reportedly told another neighbour, ""Jack the Ripper is taking a rest."" Beadle and Macpherson argued that Ellen's comments might indicate that she had knowledge of the Ripper's whereabouts."
PA,1362418-William-Henry-Bury,"Others contend that Bury only imitated the Ripper, citing differences between their crimes. Ellen Bury was strangled with a rope and sustained comparatively few knife wounds compared to the Ripper's victims, whose throats were cut prior to sustaining deep abdominal slashes. Ellen Bury's throat was not cut, and only relatively shallow cuts were made to her abdomen. The identity of the Whitechapel murderer is unknown, and over one hundred suspects, in addition to Bury, have been proposed. While some Ripper writers consider Bury a more likely culprit than many of the other suspects, other writers dismiss the theory because, ""as happens all too frequently in this field, the theorizing appears to have a few disturbing leaps of logic as well as mere anecdotes used as evidence."""

PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,"The precursor of the 1969 race riots can be traced to the 13 May Incident in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya in Malaysia. It was triggered by the results of the General Election, which were marked by Sino-Malay riots unprecedented in Malaysian history – 196 people were killed and over 350 injured between 13 May and 31 July. The real figures could be much higher than officially revealed. The Malaysian government declared a state of emergency and suspended Parliament until 1971."
PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,"The disturbances had nothing to do with Singapore but there was an inexorable spillover of the communal violence in Malaysia into Singapore. The 1969 riots occurred not long after the earlier communal riots in 1964. It was said that the 1964 racial disturbances in Singapore contributed towards the eventual separation of Singapore from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. The hysteria that United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) itself generated over its desire to assert Malay dominance (""Ketuanan Melayu"") in Singapore had its effect in heightening the suspicion between Malay and Chinese in Singapore."
PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,"The dissatisfaction of the Malays over their social and economic condition and the fear that the Malays regarded as indigenous (""Bumiputra"") ownership would be lost, led to the 13 May disturbances."
H1,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,Rumours and revenge
PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,Rumours began to spread in Singapore about Malay atrocities against the Chinese in Malaysia. People also talked indignantly about the partiality of the Malaysian Armed Forces in dealing with those suspected of involvement in the rioting; Chinese that were caught were severely punished on the spot and these rumours aggravated tension in Singapore.
PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,Over 500 people were injured and 36 lives were lost in the clashes between Chinese and Malays.
PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,"The Internal Security Department (Singapore) or ISD, together with the Police, helped contain a volatile situation. Sino-Malay tensions surfaced again in Singapore in 1969 following the outbreak of the 1969 racial riots in Malaysia after the General Election. Many incidents of Sino-Malay clashes erupted and the situation was brought under control following security sweeps by the Police and armed forces throughout Singapore. The vigilance of the security forces in Singapore and the persistent efforts of ISD officers in making island-wide coverage contributed to the return of normalcy in Singapore."
H1,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,Aftermath
PA,11847431-1969-race-riots-of-Singapore,"After 1971, when all had settled down, the Malaysian government was able to follow an affirmative action policy marked particularly by the New Economic Policy (NEP) favouring the Malays. To this day, there is still an unease about the potential of violence as the power struggles between groups continue. In Apr 1987, four silat (martial arts) exponents were arrested by the ISD for actively spreading rumours of impending racial clashes on or around 13 May 1987 (on the 18th anniversary of the May 1969 race riots in Singapore and Malaysia)."

PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"Riverside Terrace is a neighborhood in Houston, Texas, United States. The neighborhood is bounded by Almeda, North MacGregor, Scott, and Wheeler. The community, formerly an affluent Jewish neighborhood, is now a predominantly African American neighborhood with different income levels. It has been undergoing a gradual change in demographics and aesthetics due to gentrification and revitalization efforts since the early 2000s."
H1,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,History
PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"Development of Riverside Terrace began in 1924, and it was initially done by the president of Guardian Trust Company, Clarence Malone, who had cofounded the company. Guardian provided the financing, and the first section to open was the portion between Almeda Road, Blodgett Street, Live Oak Street, and Oakdale Street. The brochures highlighted the location of Riverside Terrace, which was considered favorable at the time. Riverside Terrace was designed for wealthier families. In 1927 it was annexed by the City of Houston."
PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"Jewish families moved to Riverside Terrace in the 1920s and 1930s since they were not allowed to settle in other wealthy Houston neighborhoods, including River Oaks. Therefore it became known as the ""Jewish River Oaks"". At the time most residents of Riverside Terrace were Christian. Allison Wollam of the ""Houston Business Journal"" stated that Riverside Terrace ""was once on the same affluent level as the swanky River Oaks area."" During that period the neighborhood hosted the houses of the prominent Weingarten, Finger, and McGregor families. By the 1950s initial development finished."
PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"In 1952, a wealthy African-American cattleman named Jack Caesar moved to the neighborhood. He stayed despite the fact that a bomb detonated on his front porch. Several Riverside Terrace residents opposed the growth of the community's black population, with some not wishing for racial-based violence to occur in the community and with some on the grounds that property values could decline. In 1959, land clearance began for the construction of the new Texas State Highway 288 freeway, destroying several Riverside Terrace houses. Although Caesar's home was in the path of the freeway, it was moved to another location south of Houston. Many White families left Riverside Terrace and settled in suburbs. The percentage of the population being white declined from 97% in 1950 to 5% in 1970. The population during that period increased due to the subdivision of former mansions and houses into smaller housing units and the establishment of apartments, going from 7,635 in 1950 to 12,519 in 1970."
PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"In the 1960s some Whites who wanted the neighborhood to stabilize as an integrated neighborhood posted signs stating ""This Is Our Home It Is Not For Sale."" Societal pressure and pressure from real estate agents who wanted to sell expensive homes to Black families pressed upon the remaining White and Jewish homeowners. In the spring of 1963 the South Macgregor Promotion Committee formed. It says that it placed the ""not for sale"" not because it was against African Americans moving in, but because it wanted to prevent block busting. African-American and civil rights figures backed the ""not for sale"" campaign. In 1963 the community had 175 African American families. They backed the campaign since they believed it would prevent the community from becoming a ghetto. Housing prices declined steadily around the 1960s. The South Macgregor group, which had no black members in 1963, and African-American leaders met and decided that a ratio of between 65-85% White and 15-35% Black would be beneficial to members of both racial groups."
PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"The community gradually transitioned into being majority black and having lower property values and a lower socioeconomic resident base. Wealthy African-American doctors, lawyers, politicians, and university professors moved into Riverside Terrace. As time progressed foreclosure and white flight lead to neglect of several mansions. Several large single family houses were converted into apartments, and additional low income apartment blocks were built in the area. Other large houses were converted into housing for fraternities and sororities. Many area businesses catering to the wealthy closed, and nightclubs moved in their place. Jon Schwartz, creator of the 1985 documentary, ""This Is Our Home It Is Not For Sale"", a film documenting Riverside Terrace, states that the neighborhood stabilized after 1970. Circa 1981 the Houston Planning Commission, in Kaplan's words, gave Riverside Terrace a ""fair"" rating and stated that it continued to be a ""viable community that is generally well maintained"" although the northern portion was ""in a stage of incipient decline"" and that overall ""continued decline was likely."" By the 1980s area residents were concerned that gentrification from White people and property acquisitions from area universities and the Texas Medical Center may affect their community."
PA,16815740-Riverside-Terrace--Houston,"""Houstonia"" magazine stated that Riverside Terrace began to recover in the 1990s. Riverside Terrace house sales did not follow the general housing slump in the United States of the late 2000s. The late 2000s has also seen gay couples and families moving into Riverside Terrace to improve formerly derelict mansions, though some houses remained neglected and abandoned. By 2008 some older properties were demolished and replaced with newer housing. Lisa Gray of the ""Houston Chronicle"" stated that this too was a gradual process. Recent improvements include re-development of hike and bike trails along Braes Bayou, aesthetic improvements to Almeda Road (including brick pavement and decorative street lighting), as well as renovation and modernization of some notable older homes."

PA,16081738-Old-National-Centre,"In 1882, five Freemasons decided they wished to see a Shrine organization in Indianapolis. They joined the Shrine Temple at Cincinnati, Ohio, and had that temple's help in establishing an Indianapolis temple. The local organization of the Shrine, called the Indianapolis Shriners, was given its charter on June 4, 1884. The first potentate was John T. Brush, who served as such from 1884 to 1897. Lew Wallace and Thomas Taggart were among their first Ceremonial Class, held in 1885. By the end of the first year, there were 105 members. The Indianapolis Valley of Scottish Rite gave them the Townsley and Wiggans ""Pork House"" for their meetings."

Bohlen, with Middle Eastern and Egyptian stylings that were fitting for a building intended for Shriners.

PA,16081738-Old-National-Centre,"The Murat Shrine is mostly known by the people of Indianapolis for its theater, which was built in 1910. In its early days it featured Broadway plays and even a 1932 speech by Winston Churchill. Between 1948 and 1963, it was the only road show venue in Indianapolis. Before Clowes Memorial Hall opened in 1963, it was the home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra; the Orchestra only survived the Great Depression due to the nominal fee the Temple charged the Orchestra for using the theatre. The orchestra made recordings with Fabien Sevitzky in the theater for RCA Victor between 1941 and 1953. The Indianapolis Opera Company briefly used the facility during the 1980s."

H1,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,Summary
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"Hurricane Cosme was a minimal hurricane that threatened Hawaii in mid-July 2007. The sixth tropical cyclone, third named storm and first hurricane of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Cosme originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on June 27 and tracked westward before emerging in the eastern Pacific. A system along the wave organized, and it was classified as a tropical depression on July 14, a tropical storm on July 15, and a hurricane on July 16. Cosme reached peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, but quickly weakened due to cooler waters. Steadily decreasing in strength, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression before passing to the south of the Hawaiian Islands. The depression crossed into the Central Pacific and degenerated into a remnant low by July 23."
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"Because Cosme stayed far from land, effects were mostly minor. Swells up to and up to of rainfall were reported, in addition to wind gusts of 40 mph (65 km/h). No fatalities or injuries were reported, and only minimal damage occurred."
H1,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,Meteorological history
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"The origins of Cosme can be traced back to a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on June 27, 2007. Due to a lack of associated convection, the wave was difficult to track across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean on July 8. Because the system was embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), development was initially slow. However, when it separated from the ITCZ on July 13, the disturbance increased in convective organization, and was classified as Tropical Depression Six-E about midway between Mexico and Hawaii. It tracked westward at due to steering currents of a tropical easterly flow. Although wind shear was generally light, ocean temperatures were only marginal for tropical cyclone intensification. Forecasters experienced difficulty in locating the exact center of circulation. By July 14, convection had steadily decreased, although the storm's movement was initially uncertain due to its location within a broad low pressure area. Early on July 15 the depression's appearance on satellite imagery improved, and at 1800 UTC the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, and gave it the name ""Cosme""."
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"Shortly after attaining tropical storm status, the previously-broad circulation consolidated as banding features developed. The inner core gradually condensed and tightened, as indicated by an AMSR-E overpass. On July 16 an eye began to form and Cosme intensified to attain winds of . Tracking northwest towards a weakness in the mid-level ridge, the cyclone continued to intensify and was upgraded to Hurricane Cosme late on July 16, about east of Hilo. The hurricane reached peak intensity with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), although due to cooler waters it quickly weakened to a tropical storm, as the eye became ragged and cloud-filled."
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"By July 17, the cloud pattern had deteriorated, and its winds decreased to 45 mph (75 km/h). The center subsequently became exposed, with just a few thunderstorms confined to the southwest portion of the storm as it began to accelerate to the west. As easterly vertical wind shear increased, convection temporarily reformed in a concentrated area southwest of the center. As Cosme reached steadily cooler water temperatures, it was downgraded to a tropical depression late on July 18 about southeast of Hilo, Hawaii; at around the same time, the storm entered the forecast responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Tracking westward at , maximum sustained winds were with localized higher gusts. Gradually weakening, Tropical Depression Cosme passed south of the Hawaiian Islands on July 20 with a minimum central pressure of 1010 mbar. On July 22, the depression came within of Johnston Island, and later that day, it degenerated into a remnant low."
H1,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,Preparations and impact
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"Initially, Cosme was predicted to make landfall on Hawaii as a tropical storm. In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20. Also, small craft advisories were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind advisories were issued for summits in those regions. High surf advisories were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel and opening of evacuation centers. County crews worked to clean out drains and culverts to prevent flooding."
PA,16937113-Hurricane-Cosme--2007,"Because the depression stayed far from land, the effects were mostly minor and little damage was reported. A strong trade wind swell north of Cosme generated waves up to high. Rain bands produced up to of rainfall, causing small stream and drainage ditch flooding, as well as ponding on roadways in portions of Hilo, Puna, and Kau. The rainfall helped to relieve a persistent drought which had existed for several months. Wind gusts reached 40 mph (65 km/h) in southern portions of Hawaii, causing no known damage."

BY,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"M. Drake, H. Copeland"
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"Plectrohyla cembra, also known as the Southern Sierra Madre treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is endemic to Mexico. Until recently, it was only known from two male specimens: one from its type locality on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Pochutla District, Oaxaca, and another one from Sierra de Yucuyacua south-east of Llano de Guadalupe, in north-west Oaxaca. The two locations are about apart. After having not been seen after 1993, it was feared that the species might be extinct. However, the species was rediscovered in field surveys in 2011–2012, extending its range with a new locality about 10 km north of the type locality."
H1,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,Etymology
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"The specific name ""cembra"" is Latin for ""timber"" and refers to the pine-oak forest this species inhabits."
H1,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,Taxonomy
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"A revision of the family Hylidae from 2016 places this species in the genus ""Sarcohyla"", but this classification is not yet widely adopted and as of late 2016, the Amphibian Species of the World labels it as ""provisional"". It belongs to the """"Plectrohyla bistincta"" group"" with the genus ""Plectrohyla"", all of them moved to ""Sarcohyla"" in the 2016 revision."
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"It was initially thought that the female specimen that became the holotype of ""Plectrohyla miahuatlanensis"" could be a female ""Plectrohyla cembra"", but it was eventually identified as a new, distinct species. Nevertheless, the two species are morphologically similar."
H1,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,Description
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"The holotype is a male that measures in snout–vent length, depending on the source. The second specimen, also a male, measures SVL. The body is moderately robust. The tympanum is small and indistinct. Skin is smooth on the dorsum and limbs, weakly granular on venter, chin, and ventral surfaces of thighs. The fingers are without webbing whereas the toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum was bright greenish yellow upon capture, changing to dull green. There is brown and green reticulations along sides. The throat and chest are white. The ventral sides of limbs and belly are pinkish tan. The iris is brownish yellow."
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"Male advertisement call is a short ""wrack"", often followed by a series of low ""chuckles"". Tadpoles found at the type locality, provisionally allocated to this species, measured up to in total length."
H1,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,Habitat and conservation
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,The natural habitats of this species are pine-oak forest. The holotype was found calling at night from under a piece of bark on a large log in a small stream at above sea level. The second specimen was found inside an arboreal bromeliad on a fallen oak tree at asl.
PA,12375574-Plectrohyla-cembra,"This species was only known from two specimens collected in 1969 and 1993, until it was again found in 2011–2012. Its habitat, the pine-oak forests, are under threat caused by logging and agriculture. Also chytridiomycosis might have impacted the species."
H2,19883342-Qiao-Lin,Qiao Lin
PA,19883342-Qiao-Lin,"Qiao Lin (喬琳) (died July 28, 784) was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor briefly early in the reign of Emperor Dezong. He later served the rebel ruler Zhu Ci, and after Tang forces destroyed Zhu's regime, was executed despite his old age."
H1,19883342-Qiao-Lin,Background and early career
PA,19883342-Qiao-Lin,"It is not known which year Qiao Lin was born, but it is known that his family was from Taiyuan. He was poor in his youth and lost his father early, but was studious and became known for his literary abilities. Early in Emperor Xuanzong's ""Tianbao"" era (742-756), he passed the imperial examinations and was made the sheriff of Chengwu County (成武, in modern Heze, Shandong) and later the sheriff of Xingping County (興平, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). He was later invited by the great general Guo Ziyi to serve as Guo's secretary, and later made a ""Jiancha Yushi"" (監察御史), a mid-level imperial censor. At this time, he was said to be often talkative and jocular, and he often insulted his colleagues. As a result, his relationship with a colleague, Bi Yao (畢耀), which started with mutual jocular insults, evolved into frequent serious disputes such that they accused each other of faults. Qiao was demoted to be a census officer at Ba Prefecture (巴州, in modern Bazhong, Sichuan)."
PA,19883342-Qiao-Lin,"Qiao later served as the magistrate of Nanguo County (南郭, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), and later the military chief of staff under Zhang Xiancheng (張獻誠) the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). After Zhang completed his term of office, Qiao became an assistant to Xianyu Shuming (鮮于叔明) the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan). He then successively served as the prefect of Guo Prefecture (果州, in modern Nanchong), Mian Prefecture (綿州, in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), and Sui Prefecture (遂州, in modern Suining, Sichuan). He was subsequently recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as the deputy chief judge of the supreme court (大理少卿, ""Dali Shaoqing"") and then the principal of the imperial university (國子祭酒, ""Guozi Jijiu""). Yet later, he was made the prefect of Huai Prefecture (懷州, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan)."
H1,19883342-Qiao-Lin,During Emperor Dezong's reign
PA,19883342-Qiao-Lin,"After Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong became emperor in 779, Emperor Dezong's teacher Zhang She (張涉) became an influential advisor for Emperor Dezong. Qiao was friendly with Zhang, and when Emperor Dezong asked Zhang for a recommendation for a chancellor, Zhang recommended Qiao — despite the fact that Qiao was not known for his abilities. In fall 779, Emperor Dezong, believing in Zhang's recommendations, made Qiao chief imperial censor (御史大夫, ""Yushi Daifu"") and gave him the designation ""Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi"" (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor ""de facto"" — a commission that much shocked the people. By this point, however, Qiao was old and hard of hearing, and whenever Emperor Dezong consulted him, he would rarely respond properly. After he had only served less than 90 days as a chancellor, Emperor Dezong removed him from his chancellor position and made him the minister of public works (工部尚書, ""Gongbu Shangshu""). As a result of this inappropriate recommendation, Emperor Dezong distanced himself from Zhang thereafter. In 780, Emperor Dezong made Qiao the assistant to his younger brother Li Shu (李述) the Prince of Mu in a nationwide search for his mother Empress Dowager Shen, who had disappeared during the Anshi Rebellion. (Empress Dowager Shen was ultimately never located.)"
PA,19883342-Qiao-Lin,"In 783, the soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at Chang'an to await deployment to the east in Emperor Dezong's campaigns against warlords, mutinied when they were angry that Emperor Dezong did not give them sufficient rewards. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang), and Qiao followed him there. The mutineers supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin. Qin forces, however, were not able to capture Emperor Dezong at Fengtian, and the Tang and Qin forces went into a stalemate. In spring 784, the major Tang general Li Huaiguang, angry with Emperor Dezong over Emperor Dezong's refusal to meet him, entered into an alliance with Zhu against Emperor Dezong, and Emperor Dezong was forced to further flee to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong). Qiao initially followed him but, when they reached Zhouzhi (盩厔, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), Qiao, citing his old age and his lack of a horse, declined to follow Emperor Dezong — despite Emperor Dezong's offering an imperial horse to him. Emperor Dezong, saddened, stated, ""Take care of yourself. I will bid farewell to you, Lord."" Qiao thereafter took tonsure and became a Buddhist monk at Xiaoyou Temple (仙遊寺). When Zhu heard this, he had soldiers escort Qiao back to the capital and offered him the post of minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, ""Libu Shangshu""). Qiao, after initially declining, accepted. He appeared to have mixed emotions about this, however, and one of the prospective officials that he selected for Zhu complained that the position given him was not secure, Qiao's response was an ambiguous, ""Do you really feel that this position can be secure?"""
PA,19883342-Qiao-Lin,"Later in the year, though, another major Tang general, Li Sheng, destroyed Zhu's regime (which had been renamed Han) and recaptured Chang'an. He welcomed Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an. A group of Han officials, including Qiao, were set to be executed. Li Sheng, taking pity on Qiao because of his old age, sought forgiveness on Qiao's behalf. Emperor Dezong, resenting Qiao for turning against him, refused, and ordered Qiao beheaded. On July 28, 784 (the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar), Qiao was executed along with two other major Han officials, Jiang Zhen (蔣鎮) and Zhang Guangsheng (張光晟). Before he was killed, he sighed and commented, ""I, Qiao Lin, was born on the seventh day of the seventh month, and I die here on the seventh day of the seventh month. Is it not my fate?"""

PA,1270655-Myspace,"Myspace (stylized as myspɑce) is a social networking website offering an interactive, user-submitted network of friends, personal profiles, blogs, groups, photos, music, and videos. Myspace was the largest social networking site in the world from 2005 to 2009. It is headquartered in Beverly Hills, California."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Myspace was acquired by News Corporation in July 2005 for $580 million, and in June 2006 surpassed Google as the most visited website in the United States. In April 2008, Myspace was overtaken by Facebook in the number of unique worldwide visitors and was surpassed in the number of unique U.S. visitors in May 2009, though Myspace generated $800 million in revenue during the 2008 fiscal year. Since then, the number of Myspace users has declined steadily in spite of several redesigns. As of January 2018, Myspace was ranked 4,153 by total Web traffic, and 1,657 in the United States."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Myspace had a significant influence on pop culture and music and created a computer game platform that launched the successes of Zynga and RockYou, among others. Despite an overall decline, in 2015 Myspace still had 50.6 million unique monthly visitors and had a pool of nearly 1 billion active and inactive registered users."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In June 2009, Myspace employed approximately 1,600 employees. In June 2011, Specific Media Group and Justin Timberlake jointly purchased the company for approximately $35 million. On February 11, 2016, it was announced that Myspace and its parent company had been purchased by Time Inc. Time Inc. was in turn purchased by the Meredith Corporation on January 31, 2018."
H1,1270655-Myspace,History
H1,1270655-Myspace,2003–2004: Beginnings
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In August 2003, several eUniverse employees with Friendster accounts saw potential in its social networking features. The group decided to mimic the more popular features of the website. Within 10 days, the first version of Myspace was ready for launch, implemented using ColdFusion. A complete infrastructure of finance, human resources, technical expertise, bandwidth, and server capacity was available for the site. The project was overseen by Brad Greenspan (eUniverse's Founder, Chairman, CEO), who managed Chris DeWolfe (MySpace's starting CEO), Josh Berman, Tom Anderson (MySpace's starting president), and a team of programmers and resources provided by eUniverse."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"The first Myspace users were eUniverse employees. The company held contests to see who could sign up the most users. eUniverse used its 20 million users and e-mail subscribers to breathe life into Myspace, and move it to the head of the pack of social networking websites. A key architect was tech expert Toan Nguyen who helped stabilize the Myspace platform when Brad Greenspan asked him to join the team. Co-founder and CTO Aber Whitcomb played an integral role in software architecture, utilizing the then superior development speed of ColdFusion over other dynamic database driven server-side languages of the time. Despite over ten times the number of developers, Friendster, which was developed in JavaServer Pages (jsp), could not keep up with the speed of development of Myspace and cfm."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"The MySpace.com domain was originally owned by YourZ.com, Inc., intended until 2002 for use as an online data storage and sharing site. By late 2003, it was transitioned from a file storage service to a social networking site. A friend, who also worked in the data storage business, reminded Chris DeWolfe that he had earlier bought the domain MySpace.com. DeWolfe suggested they charge a fee for the basic Myspace service. Brad Greenspan nixed the idea, believing that keeping Myspace free was necessary to make it a successful community."
LI,1270655-Myspace,2005–2009: Rise and purchase by News Corp.
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Myspace quickly gained popularity among teenagers and young adults. In February 2005, DeWolfe held talks with Mark Zuckerberg over acquiring Facebook but DeWolfe rejected Zuckerberg's $75 million offer."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Some employees of Myspace, including DeWolfe and Berman, were able to purchase equity in the property before MySpace and its parent company eUniverse (now renamed Intermix Media) was bought. In July 2005, in one of the company's first major Internet purchases, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (the parent company of Fox Broadcasting and other media enterprises) purchased Myspace for US$580 million. News Corporation had beat out Viacom by offering a higher price for the website, and the purchase was seen as a good investment at the time. Of the $580 million purchase price, approximately $327 million has been attributed to the value of Myspace according to the financial adviser fairness opinion. Within a year, Myspace had tripled in value from its purchase price. News Corporation saw the purchase as a way to capitalize on Internet advertising and drive traffic to other News Corporation properties."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"After losing the bidding war for Myspace, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone stunned the entertainment industry in September 2006 when he fired Tom Freston from the position of CEO. Redstone believed that the failure to acquire MySpace contributed to the 20% drop in Viacom's stock price in 2006 up to the date of Freston's ouster. Freston's successor as CEO, Philippe Dauman, was quoted as saying ""never, ever let another competitor beat us to the trophy"". Redstone told interviewer Charlie Rose that losing MySpace had been ""humiliating"", adding, ""MySpace was sitting there for the taking for $500 million"" (Myspace was sold in 2012 by News Corp for $35 million.)"
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In January 2006, Fox announced plans to launch a UK version of Myspace in a bid to ""tap into the UK music scene"", which they did. They released a version in China and launched similar versions in other countries."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"The 100 millionth account was created on August 9, 2006, in the Netherlands."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"On November 1, 2007, Myspace and Bebo joined the Google-led OpenSocial alliance, which already included Friendster, Hi5, LinkedIn, Plaxo, Ning and Six Apart. OpenSocial was to promote a common set of standards for software developers to write programs for social networks. Facebook remained independent. Google had been unsuccessful in building its own social networking site Orkut in the U.S. market and was using the alliance to present a counterweight to Facebook."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"By late 2007 and into 2008, Myspace was considered the leading social networking site, and consistently beat out the main competitor Facebook in traffic. Initially, the emergence of Facebook did little to diminish Myspace's popularity; at the time, Facebook was targeted only at college students. At its peak, when News Corp attempted to merge it with Yahoo! in 2007, Myspace was valued at $12 billion."
LI,1270655-Myspace,2010–2012: Decline and sale by News Corp.
PA,1270655-Myspace,"On April 19, 2008, Facebook overtook Myspace in the Alexa rankings. Since then, Myspace has seen a continuing loss of membership. There are several suggested explanations for its decline, including the fact that it stuck to a ""portal strategy"" of building an audience around entertainment and music, whereas Facebook and Twitter continually added new features to improve the social-networking experience."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Marvin L. Gittelman suggested that the $900 million three-year advertisement deal with Google while being a short-term cash windfall, was a handicap in the long run. That deal required Myspace to place even more ads on its already heavily advertised space, which made the site slow, more difficult to use, and less flexible. Myspace could not experiment with its own site without forfeiting revenue, while rival Facebook was rolling out a new clean site design. MySpace CEO Chris DeWolfe reported that he had to push back against Fox Interactive Media's sales team who monetized the site without regard to user experience."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"While Facebook focused on creating a platform that allowed outside developers to build new applications, Myspace built everything in-house. Shawn Gold, Myspace's former head of marketing and content, said ""Myspace went too wide and not deep enough in its product development. We went with a lot of products that were shallow and not the best products in the world"". The products division had introduced many features (communication tools such as instant messaging, a classifieds program, a video player, a music player, a virtual karaoke machine, a self-serve advertising platform, profile-editing tools, security systems, privacy filters, and Myspace book lists, among others). However, the features were often buggy and slow as there was insufficient testing, measuring, and iterating."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Danah Boyd, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, noted of social networking websites that Myspace and others were a very peculiar business—one in which companies might serially rise, fall, and disappear, as ""Influential peers pull others in on the climb up—and signal to flee when it's time to get out"". The volatility of social networks was exemplified in 2006 when Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal launched an investigation into children's exposure to pornography on Myspace; the resulting media frenzy and Myspace's inability to build an effective spam filter gave the site a reputation as a ""vortex of perversion"". Around that time, specialized social media companies such as Twitter formed and began targeting Myspace users, while Facebook rolled out communication tools which were seen as safe in comparison to Myspace. Boyd compared the shift of white, middle-class kids from the ""seedy"" Myspace to the ""supposedly safer haven"" of Facebook, to the ""white flight"" from American cities; the perception of Myspace eventually drove advertisers away as well. In addition, Myspace had particular problems with vandalism, phishing, malware, and spam which it failed to curtail, making the site seem inhospitable."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"These have been cited as factors why users, who as teenagers were Myspace's strongest audience in 2006 and 2016, had been migrating to Facebook. Facebook, which started strongly with the 18-to-24 group (mostly college students), has been much more successful than Myspace at attracting elderly men."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was said to be frustrated that Myspace never met expectations, as a distribution outlet for Fox studio content, and missing the US$1 billion mark in total revenues. That resulted in DeWolfe and Anderson gradually losing their status within Murdoch's inner circle of executives, plus DeWolfe's mentor Peter Chernin, the President and COO of News Corp. who was based in Los Angeles, departed the company. Former AOL executive Jonathan Miller, who joined News Corp in charge of the digital media business, was in the job for three weeks when he shuffled Myspace's executive team in April 2009. Myspace President Tom Anderson stepped down while Chris DeWolfe was replaced as Myspace CEO by former Facebook COO Owen Van Natta. A News Corp. meeting in March 2009 over the direction of Myspace was reportedly the catalyst for that management shakeup, with the Google search deal about to expire, the departure of key personnel (Myspace's COO, SVP of engineering, and SVP of strategy) to form a startup. Furthermore, the opening of extravagant new offices around the world was questioned, as rival Facebook did not have similarly expensive expansion plans yet it still attracted international users at a rapid rate. The changes to Myspace's executive ranks was followed in June 2009 by a layoff of 37.5% of its workforce (including 30% of its U.S. employees), reducing employees from 1,600 to 1,000."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In 2009, around the time that Myspace underwent layoffs and a management shakeup, the site ""relied on drastic redesigns as Hail Mary passes to get users back"". However, this may have backfired for Myspace, as it is noted that users generally disliked interface tweaks on rival Facebook (which avoided major site redesigns)."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Myspace has attempted to redefine itself as a social entertainment website, with more of a focus on music, movies, celebrities, and TV, instead of a social networking website. Myspace also developed a linkup with Facebook that would allow musicians and bands to manage their Facebook profiles. CEO Mike Jones was quoted as saying that Myspace now is a ""complementary offer"" to Facebook Inc., which is ""not a rival anymore""."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In March 2011, market research figures released by comScore suggested that Myspace had lost 10 million users between January and February 2011 and that it had fallen from 95 million to 63 million unique users during the previous twelve months. Myspace registered its sharpest audience declines in February 2011, as traffic fell 44% from a year earlier to 37.7 million unique U.S. visitors. Advertisers have been reported as unwilling to commit to long-term deals with the site."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In late February 2011, News Corp officially put the site up for sale; it was estimated to be worth $50–200 million. Losses from last quarter of 2010 were $156 million, over double the previous year, which dragged down the otherwise strong results of parent News Corp. The deadline for bids, May 31, 2011, passed without any above the reserve price of $100 million being submitted It has been said that the rapid deterioration in Myspace's business during the most recent quarter deterred many potential suitors."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"On June 29, 2011, Myspace announced to label partners and press via email that it had been acquired by Specific Media for an undisclosed sum, rumored to be a figure as low as $35 million. CNN reported that Myspace sold for $35 million, and noted that it was ""far less than the $580 million News Corp. paid for Myspace in 2005"". Rupert Murdoch went on to call the Myspace purchase a ""huge mistake"". ""Time Magazine"" compared News Corporation's purchase of Myspace to Time Warner's purchase of AOL – a conglomerate trying to stay ahead of the competition. Many former executives have gone on to further success after departing Myspace."
LI,1270655-Myspace,2013–present: Time Inc. and Meredith Corporation ownership
PA,1270655-Myspace,"On February 11, 2016, it was announced that MySpace and its parent company had been bought by Time Inc. Time Inc. was in turn purchased by the Meredith Corporation on January 31, 2018."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In May 2016, the data for almost 360 million MySpace accounts was offered on the ""Real Deal"" dark market website. The leaked data included email addresses, usernames and weakly encrypted passwords (SHA1 hashes of the first 10 characters of the password converted to lowercase and stored without a cryptographic salt). The exact data breach date is unknown, but analysis of the data suggests it was exposed around eight years before being made public, around mid-2008 to early-2009."
H1,1270655-Myspace,Features
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Since YouTube's founding in 2005, Myspace users have had the ability to embed YouTube videos in their Myspace profiles. Realizing the competitive threat to the new Myspace Videos service, Myspace banned embedded YouTube videos from its user profiles. Myspace users widely protested the ban, prompting Myspace to lift the ban shortly thereafter."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"There were a variety of environments in which users could access Myspace content on their mobile phone. American mobile phone provider Helio released a series of mobile phones in early 2006 that could utilize a service known as Myspace Mobile to access and edit one's profile and communicate with and view the profiles of other members. Additionally, UIEvolution and Myspace developed a mobile version of Myspace for a wider range of carriers, including AT&T, Vodafone and Rogers Wireless."

H1,1270655-Myspace,Music
PA,1270655-Myspace,"Shortly after Myspace was sold to News Corporation in 2005, the website launched their own record label, MySpace Records, in an effort to discover unknown talent on Myspace Music. Artists can upload their songs, EPs, and full-length albums onto Myspace. As of June 2014, over 53 million songs have been uploaded to Myspace by 14.2 million artists. Artists such as The Summer Obsession, Lily Allen, Owl City, Hollywood Undead, Sean Kingston, Arctic Monkeys, Echobelly, Ice Nine Kills, and Drop Dead, Gorgeous gained fame through Myspace. Over eight million artists have been discovered by Myspace. In late 2007, the site launched The MySpace Transmissions, a series of live-in-studio recordings by well-known artists."
H1,1270655-Myspace,Redesigns
PA,1270655-Myspace,"On March 10, 2010, Myspace added some new features, like a recommendation engine for new users which suggests games, music, and videos based on their previous search habits. The security on Myspace was also accounted to, with the criticism of Facebook, to make it a safer site. The security of Myspace enables users to choose if the content could be viewed for Friends Only, 18 and older, or Everyone. The website will also release several mobile micro applications for Myspace gamers besides sending them games alerts. The site may release 20 to 30 micro apps and go mobile in 2011."
PA,1270655-Myspace,"In October 2010, Myspace introduced a beta version of a new site design on a limited scale, with plans to switch all interested users to the new site in late November. Chief executive Mike Jones said the site is no longer competing with Facebook as a general social networking site. Instead, Myspace would be music-oriented and would target younger people. Jones believed most younger users would continue to use the site after the redesign, though older users might not. The goal of the redesign is to increase the number of Myspace users and how long they spend there. On October 26, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said, ""Most investors have written off MySpace now"", and he was unsure whether the changes would help the company recover."

PA,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,"Sir Arthur Basil Markham, 1st Baronet (25 August 1866 – 5 August 1916) was a British industrialist and politician."
H1,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,Life
PA,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,"Markham was born on 25 August 1866 at Brimington Hall in Brimington, near Chesterfield. He was the son of Charles Markham who was part owner of the family coal mine, Markham Colliery, in Chesterfield. On his mother's side he was the grandson of Sir Joseph Paxton, designer of The Great Exhibition's Crystal Palace. He was educated at Rugby School. In 1898 he married Lucy Bertram Cunningham (c.1873–4 February 1960)."
PA,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,Markham served from 1900 to 1916 served as Liberal M.P. for the Mansfield Division of Nottinghamshire.
PA,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,"He was created a baronet, Markham of Beachborough Park, Newington, Kent, on 10 July 1911. The districts of Beachborough and Newington are now eclipsed by the Eurotunnel terminus on the outskirts of Folkestone."
PA,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,"Arthur Markham's technical skill, commercial insight and courage helped the development of considerable parts of the English and Welsh coalfields. He managed and owned a number of other coalmines, and there are many villages, businesses, streets and areas in Wales, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire bearing the name Markham. His brother was Charles Paxton Markham owner of Markham & Co. Engineering of Chesterfield. The firm was one of largest suppliers of coal mine winders. His brother was also director of Staveley Coal and Iron Company."
PA,17913557-Sir-Arthur-Markham--1st-Baronet,"During the First World War, Markham and his wife made their house near Folkestone available to the government for the accommodation of overseas officers and also purchased and sent aid packages to British prisoners of war in German hands. Lady Markham also nursed. Markham fought tirelessly against the recruitment of under age soldiers into the British Army during the war, and ultimately, these efforts contributed to his untimely death at the age of 50."

The Arthur Markham Memorial Fund was used to give a prize for the best essay written by a manual worker on a subject chosen for that year. The competition had been chosen as both Markhams (Violet and Arthur) believed that there was untapped intelligence that needed to be rewarded."
LI,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,Pećanac Chetniks
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"The Pećanac Chetniks, also known as the Black Chetniks, were a collaborationist Chetnik irregular military force which operated in the German-occupied territory of Serbia under the leadership of ""vojvoda"" (war lord) Kosta Pećanac. They were loyal to the German-backed Serbian puppet government."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"Pećanac was eventually denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little military aid to them. The Germans and the puppet government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943, and Pećanac was interned for some time afterwards before being killed in mid-1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović."
H1,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,Background
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"The Pećanac Chetniks were named after their commander, Kosta Pećanac, who was a fighter and later ""vojvoda"" in the Serbian Chetnik Organization who had first distinguished himself in fighting against the Ottoman Empire in Macedonia between 1903 and 1910. In the First Balkan War, fought from October 1912 to May 1913, Pećanac served as a sergeant in the Royal Serbian Army. During the Second Balkan War, fought from 29 June to 10 August 1913, he saw combat against the Kingdom of Bulgaria. During World War I, he led bands of Serbian guerillas fighting behind Bulgarian and Austro-Hungarian lines."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"He was the most prominent figure in the Chetnik movement during the interwar period. He had a leading role in the Association Against Bulgarian Bandits, a notorious organisation that arbitrarily terrorised Bulgarians in the Štip region, part of modern-day Macedonia. He also served as a commander with the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists (ORJUNA). As a member of parliament, he was present when the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) leader Stjepan Radić and HSS deputies Pavle Radić and Đuro Basariček were killed by the Serb politician Puniša Račić on 20 June 1928. Prior to the shooting, Pećanac was accused by HSS deputy Ivan Pernar of being responsible for a massacre of 200 Muslims in 1921."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"Pećanac became the president of the Chetnik Association in 1932. By opening membership of the organisation to younger members that had not served in World War I, he grew the organisation during the 1930s from a nationalist veterans' association focused on protecting veterans' rights to an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with 500,000 members throughout the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period, Pećanac formed close ties with the far-right Yugoslav Radical Union government of Milan Stojadinović, and was known for his hostility to the Yugoslav Communist Party, which made him popular with conservatives such as those in the Yugoslav Radical Union."
H1,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,Formation
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"Shortly before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Yugoslav Ministry of the Army and Navy requested that Pećanac prepare for guerrilla operations and guard the southern area of Serbia, Macedonia, and Kosovo from pro-Bulgarians and pro-Albanians in the region. He was given arms and money, and managed to arm several hundred men in the Toplica River valley in southern Serbia. Pećanac's force remained intact after the German occupation of Serbia and supplemented its strength from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo. In the early summer of 1941, Pećanac's detachments fought against Albanian bands. At this time and for a considerable period after, only detachments under Pećanac were identified by the term ""Chetnik"". With the formation of the communist-led Yugoslav Partisans, Pećanac gave up any interest in resistance, and by late August came to agreements with both the Serbian puppet government and the German authorities to carry out attacks against the Partisans."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"Pećanac kept the organisational structure of his detachments simple. All of the commanders were selected personally by Pećanac and consisted of former officers, peasants, Orthodox priests, teachers, and merchants. The Pećanac Chetniks were also known as the ""Black Chetniks""."
LI,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,Collaboration with occupation and quisling forces
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"On 18 August 1941, while he was concluding arrangements with the Germans, Pećanac received a letter from rival Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović proposing an arrangement where Pećanac would control the Chetniks south of the Western Morava River while Mihailović would control the Chetniks in all other areas. Pećanac declined this request and suggested that he might offer Mihailović the position as his chief of staff. He also recommended that Mihailović's detachments disband and join his organisation. In the meantime, Pećanac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"On 27 August, Pećanac issued an open ""Proclamation to the Dear People"", in which he portrayed himself as the defender and protector of Serbs and, referring to Mihailović's units, called on ""detachments that have been formed without his approval"" to come together under his command. He demanded that individuals hiding in the forests return to their homes immediately and that acts of sabotage directed at the occupation authorities cease or suffer the punishment of death."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"In September 1941, some of Pećanac's subordinates broke ranks to join the Partisans in fighting the Germans and their Serbian auxiliaries. In the mountainous Kopaonik region, a previously loyal subordinate of Pećanac began attacking local gendarmerie stations and clashing with armed bands of Albanian Muslims. By the end of October the Germans decided to stop arming the ""unreliable"" elements within Pećanac's Chetniks, and attached the remainder to their other Serbian auxiliary forces."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"On 7 October 1941, Pećanac sent a request to the head of the Serbian puppet government, Milan Nedić, for trained officers, supplies, arms, salary funds, and more. Over time his requests were fulfilled, and a German liaison officer was appointed at Pećanac's headquarters to help coordinate actions. On 17 January 1942, according to German data, 72 Chetnik officers and 7,963 men were being paid and supplied by the Serbian Gendarmerie. This fell short of their maximum authorised strength of 8,745 men, and included two or three thousand of Mihailović's Chetniks who had been ""legalised"" in November 1941. In the same month, Pećanac sought permission from the Italians for his forces to move into eastern Montenegro, but was refused due to Italian concerns that the Chetniks would move into the Sandžak."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, ""General der Artillerie"" Paul Bader, issued orders giving the unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, which were placed under the command of the local German division or area command post. These orders required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and also limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supplies of arms and ammunition were also controlled by the Germans. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor, and his continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I."
H1,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,Dissolution
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"The Germans found that Pećanac's units were inefficient, unreliable, and of little military aid to them. Pećanac's Chetniks regularly clashed and had rivalries with other German auxiliaries such as the Serbian State Guard and Serbian Volunteer Command and also with Mihailović's Chetniks. The Germans and the puppet government commenced disbanding them in September 1942, and all but one had been dissolved by the end of that year. The last detachment was disbanded in March 1943. His followers were dispersed to other German auxiliary forces, German labour units, or were interned in prisoner-of-war camps. Many deserted to join Mihailović. Nothing is recorded of Pećanac's activities in the months that followed except that he was interned for some time by the Serbian puppet government."
PA,15879096-Pećanac-Chetniks,"Accounts of Pećanac's capture and death vary. According to one account, Pećanac, four of his leaders and 40 of their followers were captured by forces loyal to Mihailović in February 1944. All were killed within days except Pećanac, who remained in custody to write his war memoirs before being executed on 5 May 1944. Another source states he was assassinated on 6 June 1944 by Chetniks loyal to Mihailović."

PA,12529705-Gary-D-Addario,"D'Addario joined the Baltimore police department in 1967. An Italian-American, D'Addario advanced in the department easily during the days of the BPD's brief ""Holy Roman Empire"", the time period from 1981–1984 under former Commissioner Frank Battaglia where Italian-American police officers of Baltimore briefly controlled the previously Irish-American dominated department. D'Addario served as a shift lieutenant in the Baltimore Police Department homicide unit for 10 years during his career. He was a captain in 1998 and was promoted to major in 2003. He retired at the rank of major in 2004. The 37-year veteran of the department was forced to retire by new Commissioner Kevin P. Clark in 2004 as part of Clark's unpopular turnover of veteran command staff."

PA,12529705-Gary-D-Addario,"The book was adapted into an NBC television series called """" and D'Addario inspired the character Al Giardello on that series. D'Addario had a recurring role on ""Homicide"" as Lt. Jasper, head of the Quick Response Team. He also worked as a technical advisor on ""Homicide"" primarily as a source on the Baltimore Police Department and a liaison between the production and the department. Simon later moved from writing books to television and became a writer and producer for the series. D'Addario was a technical advisor for Simon's next project, the Emmy Award-winning miniseries ""The Corner"", and had a small role as a desk sergeant."

D'Addario had a recurring role as the gambling-addicted grand jury prosecutor Gary DiPasquale in ""The Wire"". Simon has speculated that D'Addario's first appearance on the series in the season 2 episode ""Undertow"" coincided with his forced retirement. Simon wrote to Mayor Martin O'Malley to ask if there was any link and seeking confirmation that other city employees did not risk losing their jobs by appearing on the series and received no response. D'Addario stood down as technical advisor because he was no longer part of the police department but continued to appear on the show until its conclusion."

H1,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,Abstract
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"The case stood for the proposition that a no-owning cohabitee contributing to the cost of running a house and, even, quite common renovations to a derelict property did not, in itself, create a beneficial interest in that person's favour. All of the reasoning of the judgment was delivered Lord Bridge, receiving four concurrences from the other judges who had read his judgment in advance. Its strict limits on equity flowing to a non-owning partner were doubted in ""Stack v Dowden"", in which the final court of appeal sitting in 2007 said ""the law has moved on""."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"In the lower court it dealt with a follow-on aspect of finding — instead — a valid contribution: the question of whether, in a repossession scenario the pre-purchase home improver who is not the borrower nor the legal owner (in this case it was the spouse/partner of the borrower) is in ""actual occupation"". If so that would override and outrank the lender's interests in the property. That court's panel found (2-1) that Rosset's renovation works during the school day, including on the date of making of the mortgage/secured overdraft, did amount to actual occupation."
H1,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,Facts
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"Mr and Mrs Rosset had bought a semi-derelict house called Vincent Farmhouse on Manston Road, in Thanet, Kent, with Mr Rosset’s family trust money. The trustees had insisted on his sole ownership as a condition for taking the trust money. He had funded the cost of the renovations to the house. She had made no financial contributions to the acquisition or renovations, but had done decorating and helped by assisting in the professional building works in the immediate two months before their full-time moving in (including at night). Mrs Rosset was in possession of the home on 7 November 1982, but contracts were not exchanged until 23 November. Mr Rosset took out a loan from Lloyds Bank and secured it with a mortgage on the home. The charge was executed on 14 December, without Mrs Rosset’s knowledge, and completion took place on 17 December. The charge was registered on 7 February 1983. Then Mr Rosset defaulted on the loan. Lloyd's Bank sought possession of the home in the late 1980s as the loan fell into arrears."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"Mrs Rosset argued that she had a right to stay because she had not consented to the mortgage, and she had an overriding interest in the property. Under the Land Registration Act 1925 section 70(1)(g) (now Land Registration Act 2002 Schedule 3, paragraph 2) the bank's interest therefore ranked behind hers."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"The bank contended she had no property rights in the home, amongst other things, because the work she had done was not enough to give her an equitable proprietary right. Secondly, as found in the lower courts, she was not ""in actual occupation"" at the relevant date."
H1,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,Judgment
H1,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,Court of Appeal
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"The Court of Appeal 2—1 held that Mrs Rosset was in actual occupation of her home. Nicholls LJ held that it had been a common intention, on the facts, that she would share in the property. She had done acts to her detriment, and she was in actual occupation at the relevant date through the builders, agreeing with the court below. The term ‘actual occupation’ does not require physical presence, and daily visits of Mrs Rosset to the semi derilict house was enough. He also suggested builders for Mrs Rosset were also occupying on her behalf."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"Purchas LJ agreed. He clarified in his view the meaning of actual occupation should reflect equitable rules, and so undiscoverable people’s interests would not bind. Further in his view Mrs Rosset's occupation was ""discoverable""."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"Mustill LJ dissented, finding Rossett not, in his view in actual occupation."
H2,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,House of Lords
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"The court decided Mrs Rosset had no beneficial interest in the property. There were no discussions to that effect, and the work Mrs Rosset did was not enough for a constructive trust."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"The court also held, ""obiter"", the date to determine whether Mrs Rosset was in occupation under LRA 1925 section 70 was the date the charge was created, i.e. 17 December just as Scarlett J had interpreted the law at trial; however it abjectly refused to be drawn into whether Rosset was ""in actual occupation"" (clarifying this would need to be before completion). In this court's view, finding unlike the courts below, no equitable interest of Rosset, it would be unnecessary to look at her actual occupation as she in reality had no strict economic right to be there so as to outrank the lender."
PA,16865772-Lloyds-Bank-plc-v-Rosset,"Lord Bridge gave the only legal opinion, holding that because there had never been any express agreement that she would have a share, nor any contributions to the purchase price, Mrs Rosset could establish no right in the home.

H1,18838-Mammal,Mammal
PA,18838-Mammal,"Mammals (from Latin ""mamma"" ""breast"") are vertebrate animals constituting the class Mammalia (), and characterized by the presence of mammary glands which in females produce milk for feeding (nursing) their young, a neocortex (a region of the brain), fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which they diverged in the late Triassic, 201–227 million years ago. There are around 5,450 species of mammals. The largest orders are the rodents, bats and Soricomorpha (shrews and others). The next three are the Primates (humans, apes, monkeys, and others), the Cetartiodactyla (whales and even-toed ungulates), and the Carnivora (cats, dogs, seals, and others)."
PA,18838-Mammal,"In cladistics, which reflect evolution, mammals are classified as endothermic amniotes. They are the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida (reptiles and birds) form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian ""Dimetrodon"". At the end of the Carboniferous period around 300 million years ago, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to the present."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The basic body type is quadruped, and most mammals use their four extremities for terrestrial locomotion; but in some, the extremities are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground, or on two legs. Mammals range in size from the bumblebee bat to the blue whale—the largest animal on the planet. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale. All modern mammals give birth to live young, except the five species of monotremes, which are egg-laying mammals. The most species-rich group of mammals, the cohort called placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Most mammals are intelligent, with some possessing large brains, self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize in several different ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies—but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Domestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in the Neolithic revolution, and resulted in farming replacing hunting and gathering as the primary source of food for humans. This led to a major restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary, with more co-operation among larger and larger groups, and ultimately the development of the first civilizations. Domesticated mammals provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as food (meat and dairy products), fur, and leather. Mammals are also hunted and raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Decline in numbers and extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and habitat destruction, primarily deforestation."
H1,18838-Mammal,Classification
PA,18838-Mammal,"Mammal classification has been through several iterations since Carl Linnaeus initially defined the class. No classification system is universally accepted; McKenna & Bell (1997) and Wilson & Reader (2005) provide useful recent compendiums. George Gaylord Simpson's ""Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals"" (AMNH ""Bulletin"" v. 85, 1945) provides systematics of mammal origins and relationships that were universally taught until the end of the 20th century. Since Simpson's classification, the paleontological record has been recalibrated, and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though field work gradually made Simpson's classification outdated, it remains the closest thing to an official classification of mammals."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Most mammals, including the six most species-rich orders, belong to the placental group. The three largest orders in numbers of species are Rodentia: mice, rats, porcupines, beavers, capybaras and other gnawing mammals; Chiroptera: bats; and Soricomorpha: shrews, moles and solenodons. The next three biggest orders, depending on the biological classification scheme used, are the Primates including the apes, monkeys and lemurs; the Cetartiodactyla including whales and even-toed ungulates; and the Carnivora which includes cats, dogs, weasels, bears, seals and allies. According to ""Mammal Species of the World"", 5,416 species were identified in 2006. These were grouped into 1,229 genera, 153 families and 29 orders. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) completed a five-year Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List, which counted 5,488 species. According to a research published in the ""Journal of Mammalogy"" in 2018, the number of recognized mammal species is 6,495 species included 96 recently extinct."
H1,18838-Mammal,Definitions
PA,18838-Mammal,"The word ""mammal"" is modern, from the scientific name ""Mammalia"" coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin ""mamma"" (""teat, pap""). In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group of mammals, the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes (echidnas and platypuses) and therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) and all descendants of that ancestor. Since this ancestor lived in the Jurassic period, Rowe's definition excludes all animals from the earlier Triassic, despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the Haramiyida have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century. If Mammalia is considered as the crown group, its origin can be roughly dated as the first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others. ""Ambondro"" is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while ""Amphilestes"" and ""Amphitherium"" are more closely related to the therians; as fossils of all three genera are dated about in the Middle Jurassic, this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group."
PA,18838-Mammal,"T. S. Kemp has provided a more traditional definition: ""synapsids that possess a dentary–squamosal jaw articulation and occlusion between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to the movement"" or, equivalently in Kemp's view, the clade originating with the last common ancestor of ""Sinoconodon"" and living mammals. The earliest known synapsid satisfying Kemp's definitions is ""Tikitherium"", dated , so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this Late Triassic date."
H1,18838-Mammal,McKenna/Bell classification
PA,18838-Mammal,"In 1997, the mammals were comprehensively revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, which has resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, ""Classification of Mammals above the Species Level"", is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia."

PA,18838-Mammal,"Molecular studies based on DNA analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families over the last few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Estimates for the divergence times between these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago, depending on the type of DNA used (such as nuclear or mitochondrial) and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data."

H1,18838-Mammal,Evolution
H1,18838-Mammal,Origins
PA,18838-Mammal,"Synapsida, a clade that contains mammals and their extinct relatives, originated during the Pennsylvanian subperiod (~323 million to ~300 million years ago), when they split from reptilian and avian lineages. Crown group mammals evolved from earlier mammaliaforms during the Early Jurassic. The cladogram takes Mammalia to be the crown group."
H1,18838-Mammal,Evolution from amniotes
PA,18838-Mammal,"The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, they had lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes that allow the developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The first amniotes apparently arose in the Pennsylvanian subperiod of the Carboniferous. They descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods, which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as ferns, mosses and other plants. Within a few million years, two important amniote lineages became distinct: the synapsids, which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals; and the sauropsids, which now include turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs and birds. Synapsids have a single hole (temporal fenestra) low on each side of the skull. One synapsid group, the pelycosaurs, included the largest and fiercest animals of the early Permian. Nonmammalian synapsids are sometimes called ""mammal-like reptiles""."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Therapsids, a group of synapsids, descended from pelycosaurs in the Middle Permian, about 265 million years ago, and became the dominant land vertebrates. They differ from basal eupelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including: larger skulls and incisors which are equal in size in therapsids, but not for eupelycosaurs. The therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages, beginning with animals that were very similar to their pelycosaur ancestors and ending with probainognathian cynodonts, some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals. Those stages were characterized by:"
PA,18838-Mammal,The gradual development of a bony secondary palate.
PA,18838-Mammal,"Progression towards an erect limb posture, which would increase the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The dentary gradually became the main bone of the lower jaw which, by the Triassic, progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles)."
H1,18838-Mammal,First mammals
PA,18838-Mammal,"The Permian–Triassic extinction event about 252 million years ago, which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids. In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which, over an extended period (35 million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs, the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs; however, large cynodonts like ""Trucidocynodon"" and traversodontids still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) appeared in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million years after the first therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; The Jurassic ""Castorocauda"", for example, was a close relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the Nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids. The earliest known metatherian is ""Sinodelphys"", found in 125 million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The oldest known fossil among the Eutheria (""true beasts"") is the small shrewlike "" Juramaia sinensis"", or ""Jurassic mother from China"", dated to 160 million years ago in the late Jurassic. A later eutherian relative, ""Eomaia"", dated to 125 million years ago in the early Cretaceous, possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals, evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage. In particular, the epipubic bones extend forwards from the pelvis. These are not found in any modern placental, but they are found in marsupials, monotremes, other nontherian mammals and ""Ukhaatherium"", an early Cretaceous animal in the eutherian order Asioryctitheria. This also applies to the multituberculates. They are apparently an ancestral feature, which subsequently disappeared in the placental lineage. These epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening the muscles during locomotion, reducing the amount of space being presented, which placentals require to contain their fetus during gestation periods. A narrow pelvic outlet indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short, as in modern marsupials. This suggests that the placenta was a later development."
PA,18838-Mammal,"One of the earliest known monotremes was ""Teinolophos"", which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca)—as lizards and birds also do— and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified."
LI,18838-Mammal,Earliest appearances of features
PA,18838-Mammal,"""Hadrocodium"", whose fossils date from approximately 195 million years ago, in the early Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of ""Castorocauda"" and ""Megaconus"", from 164 million years ago in the mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones in the front of the upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard ""Tupinambis"" has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont ""Thrinaxodon"". Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to ""Thrinaxodon"". Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts."
PA,18838-Mammal,"When endothermy first appeared in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete—living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared sometime in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it is found in the eutherian ""Eomaia"" and the metatherian ""Sinodelphys"", both dated to 125 million years ago. Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental mammaliformes, though ""Megazostrodon"" and ""Erythrotherium"" appear to have lacked them."
PA,18838-Mammal,"It has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals."
H1,18838-Mammal,Rise of the mammals
PA,18838-Mammal,"Therian mammals took over the medium- to large-sized ecological niches in the Cenozoic, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups, and underwent an exponential increase in body size (megafauna). Then mammals diversified very quickly; both birds and mammals show an exponential rise in diversity. For example, the earliest known bat dates from about 50 million years ago, only 16 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Molecular phylogenetic studies initially suggested that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. However, no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals comes from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have identified an early Paleocene animal named ""Protungulatum donnae"" as one of the first placental mammals. however it has been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian. Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The earliest known ancestor of primates is ""Archicebus achilles"" from around 55 million years ago. This tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams (0.7–1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm."
H1,18838-Mammal,Anatomy
H1,18838-Mammal,Distinguishing features
PA,18838-Mammal,"Living mammal species can be identified by the presence of sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils."
PA,18838-Mammal,Many traits shared by all living mammals appeared among the earliest members of the group:
PA,18838-Mammal,"Jaw joint – The dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet to form the joint. In most gnathostomes, including early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw)."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Middle ear – In crown-group mammals, sound is carried from the eardrum by a chain of three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the articular and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Tooth replacement – Teeth are replaced once or (as in toothed whales and murid rodents) not at all, rather than being replaced continually throughout life."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Prismatic enamel – The enamel coating on the surface of a tooth consists of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from the dentin to the tooth's surface."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Occipital condyles – Two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost neck vertebra; most other tetrapods, in contrast, have only one such knob."
PA,18838-Mammal,"For the most part, these characteristics were not present in the Triassic ancestors of the mammals. Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals."
H1,18838-Mammal,Biological systems
PA,18838-Mammal,"The majority of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The lungs of mammals are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly achieved with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing the volume of the lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The mammalian heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The integumentary system is made up of three layers: the outermost epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer. Its outermost cells are constantly lost; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward. The middle layer, the dermis, is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis. The dermis is made up of many components, such as bony structures and blood vessels. The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue, which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species; marine mammals require a thick hypodermis (blubber) for insulation, and right whales have the thickest blubber at . Although other animals have features such as whiskers, feathers, setae, or cilia that superficially resemble it, no animals other than mammals have hair. It is a definitive characteristic of the class. Though some mammals have very little, careful examination reveals the characteristic, often in obscure parts of their bodies."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Herbivores have developed a diverse range of physical structures to facilitate the consumption of plant material. To break up intact plant tissues, mammals have developed teeth structures that reflect their feeding preferences. For instance, frugivores (animals that feed primarily on fruit) and herbivores that feed on soft foliage have low-crowned teeth specialized for grinding foliage and seeds. Grazing animals that tend to eat hard, silica-rich grasses, have high-crowned teeth, which are capable of grinding tough plant tissues and do not wear down as quickly as low-crowned teeth. Most carnivorous mammals have carnassialiforme teeth (of varying length depending on diet), long canines and similar tooth replacement patterns."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The stomach of Artiodactyls is divided into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only ruminants have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump together to form a bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The mammalian excretory system involves many components. Like most other land animals, mammals are ureotelic, and convert ammonia into urea, which is done by the liver as part of the urea cycle. Bilirubin, a waste product derived from blood cells, is passed through bile and urine with the help of enzymes excreted by the liver. The passing of bilirubin via bile through the intestinal tract gives mammalian feces a distinctive brown coloration. Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla, which is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle. Only the mammalian kidney has a bean shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds, cetaceans and bears. Most adult placental mammals have no remaining trace of the cloaca. In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus, and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual: in females, it develops into the vestibule that receives the urethra and vagina, while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra. However, the tenrecs, golden moles, and some shrews retain a cloaca as adults. In marsupials, the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally. Monotremes, which translates from Greek into ""single hole"", have a true cloaca."
H1,18838-Mammal,Sound production
PA,18838-Mammal,"As in all other tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and surrounding musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, as opposed to the vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Some mammals have a large larynx and thus a low-pitched voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (""Hypsignathus monstrosus"") where the larynx can take up the entirety of the thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (""Loxodonta"" spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produce ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to lower the resonances or increase the volume of sound."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The vocal production system is controlled by the cranial nerve nuclei in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, elephants and possibly bats; in humans, this is the result of a direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord."
H1,18838-Mammal,Fur
H1,18838-Mammal,Function
PA,18838-Mammal,"The primary function of the fur of mammals is thermoregulation. Others include protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage."
H1,18838-Mammal,Types
PA,18838-Mammal,Definitive – which may be shed after reaching a certain length.
LI,18838-Mammal,"Vibrissae – sensory hairs, most commonly whiskers."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Elage – guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair."
PA,18838-Mammal,Spines – stiff guard hair used for defense (Example: porcupines).
PA,18838-Mammal,Bristles – long hairs usually used in visual signals. (Example: lion mane).
PA,18838-Mammal,"Velli – often called ""down fur"" which insulates newborn mammals."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Wool – long, soft and often curly."
LI,18838-Mammal,Thermoregulation
PA,18838-Mammal,"Hair length is not a factor in thermoregulation: for example, some tropical mammals such as sloths have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the musk ox has guard hairs measuring as well as a dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of . Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach in the summer, but the skin stays at . Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry."
H1,18838-Mammal,Coloration
PA,18838-Mammal,"Mammalian coats are colored for a variety of reasons, the major selective pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication, and thermoregulation."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (""Alopex lagopus""), collared lemming (""Dicrostonyx groenlandicus""), stoat (""Mustela erminea""), and snowshoe hare (""Lepus americanus""), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, is the result of a symbiotic relationship with algae."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin."
H1,18838-Mammal,Reproductive system
PA,18838-Mammal,"In male placentals, the penis is used both for urination and copulation. Depending on the species, an erection may be fueled by blood flow into vascular, spongy tissue or by muscular action. A penis may be contained in a prepuce when not erect, and some placentals also have a penis bone (baculum). Marsupials typically have forked penises, while the echidna penis generally has four heads with only two functioning. The testes of most mammals descend into the scrotum which is typically posterior to the penis but is often anterior in marsupials. Female mammals generally have a clitoris, labia majora and labia minora on the outside, while the internal system contains paired oviducts, 1-2 uteri, 1-2 cervices and a vagina. Marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina. The ""vagina"" of monotremes is better understood as a ""urogenital sinus"". The uterine systems of placental mammals can vary between a duplex, were there are two uteri and cervices which open into the vagina, a bipartite, were two uterine horns have a single cervix that connects to the vagina, a bicornuate, which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a Y-shape, and a simplex, which has a single uterus."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is the birthing of relatively undeveloped, either through direct vivipary or a short period as soft-shelled eggs. This is likely due to the fact that the torso could not expand due to the presence of epipubic bones. The oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with ""Kayentatherium"", which produced undeveloped perinates, but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal, 38 specimens. Most modern mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake. In placental mammals, the epipubic is either completely lost or converted into the baculum; allowing the torso to be able to expand and thus produce developed offspring."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The mammary glands of mammals are specialized to produce milk, the primary source of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly. Compared to placental mammals, the milk of marsupials changes greatly in both production rate and in nutrient composition, due to the underdeveloped young. In addition, the mammary glands have more autonomy allowing them to supply separate milks to young at different development stages. Lactose is the main sugar in placental mammal milk while monotreme and marsupial milk is dominated by oligosaccharides. Weaning is the process in which a mammal becomes less dependent on their mother's milk and more on solid food."
H2,18838-Mammal,Endothermy
PA,18838-Mammal,"Nearly all mammals are endothermic (""warm-blooded""). Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic (""cold-blooded"") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy is not unique to mammals."
H1,18838-Mammal,Species lifespan
PA,18838-Mammal,"Among mammals, species maximum lifespan varies significantly (for example the shrew has a lifespan of two years, whereas the oldest bowhead whale is recorded to be 211 years). Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain, numerous studies indicate that the ability to repair DNA damages is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan. In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow, it was found that DNA excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species. Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognize DNA double-strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein Ku80. In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species, genes employed in DNA repair were found to be up-regulated in the longer-lived species. The cellular level of the DNA repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species. Three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and DNA repair capability."
H1,18838-Mammal,Locomotion
H1,18838-Mammal,Terrestrial
PA,18838-Mammal,"Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the reptiles and some mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, walking on the whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Animals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension."
H1,18838-Mammal,Arboreal
PA,18838-Mammal,"Arboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, the tip of the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip."
H1,18838-Mammal,Aerial
PA,18838-Mammal,"Bats are the only mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a constant speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than those of birds, allowing bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response."
H1,18838-Mammal,Fossorial and subterranean
PA,18838-Mammal,"A fossorial (from Latin ""fossor"", meaning ""digger"") is an animal adapted to digging which lives primarily, but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers, and naked mole-rats. Many rodent species are also considered fossorial because they live in burrows for most but not all of the day. Species that live exclusively underground are described as ""subterranean"". Some organisms are fossorial to aid in temperature regulation while others use the underground habitat for protection from predators or for food storage. An animal is said to be ""sub-fossorial"" if it shows limited adaptations to a fossorial lifestyle."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at the shoulders and tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable to see in the dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Many fossorial mammals such as shrews, hedgehogs, and moles were classified under the now obsolete order Insectivora."
H1,18838-Mammal,Aquatic
PA,18838-Mammal,"Fully aquatic mammals, the cetaceans and sirenians, have lost their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Semi-aquatic mammals, like pinnipeds, have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim. They rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Other semi-aquatic mammals include beavers, hippopotamuses, otters and platypuses. Hippos are very large semi-aquatic mammals, and their barrel-shaped bodies have graviportal skeletal structures, adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river."
H1,18838-Mammal,Behavior
H1,18838-Mammal,Communication and vocalization
PA,18838-Mammal,"Many mammals communicate by vocalizing. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls, to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals to ward off other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer. The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; they have different dialects in different regions of the ocean. Social vocalizations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator. Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are infrasonic, below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to away at still times near sunrise and sunset."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Mammals signal by a variety of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, honestly indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation."
H1,18838-Mammal,Feeding
PA,18838-Mammal,"To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive—mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals—this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores."
PA,18838-Mammal,"The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type (Allen's rule). Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites)."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Some mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory, generally leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50–70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, and in some cases strong jaws for bone-crushing, as in the case of hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Some physiological carnivores consume plant matter and some physiological herbivores consume meat. From a behavioral aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Many mammals, in the absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment, suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as hibernation. In the period preceding hibernation, larger mammals, such as bears, become polyphagic to increase fat stores, whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food. The slowing of the metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate, as well as a drop in internal temperatures, which can be around ambient temperature in some cases. For example, the internal temperatures of hibernating arctic ground squirrels can drop to , however the head and neck always stay above . A few mammals in hot environments aestivate in times of drought or extreme heat, namely the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (""Cheirogaleus medius"")."
H1,18838-Mammal,Intelligence
PA,18838-Mammal,"In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Tool use by animals may indicate different levels of learning and cognition. The sea otter uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour (smashing abalone from rocks or breaking open shells), with some populations spending 21% of their time making tools. Other tool use, such as chimpanzees using twigs to ""fish"" for termites, may be developed by watching others use tools and may even be a true example of animal teaching. Tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which the animal appears to experience a ""Eureka moment"". Other mammals that do not use tools, such as dogs, can also experience a Eureka moment."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging and in mature males."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Self-awareness appears to be a sign of abstract thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. Mammals that have 'passed' the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); bottlenose dolphins killer whales; and false killer whales."
H1,18838-Mammal,Social structure
PA,18838-Mammal,"Eusociality is the highest level of social organization. These societies have an overlap of adult generations, the division of reproductive labor and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees, ants and termites, have eusocial behavior, but it is demonstrated in two rodent species: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Presociality is when animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually."
PA,18838-Mammal,"A fission-fusion society is a society that changes frequently in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the ""parent group"". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission–fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, spotted hyenas, lions, and dolphins."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Solitary animals defend a territory and avoid social interactions with the members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey."
PA,18838-Mammal,"In a hierarchy, individuals are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant while the others are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals where there is a top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (""Desmodus rotundus""), may be more strict."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Some mammals are perfectly monogamous, meaning that they mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate's death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs when males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals."
PA,18838-Mammal,"All higher mammals (excluding monotremes) share two major adaptations for care of the young: live birth and lactation. These imply a group-wide choice of a degree of parental care. They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in, or feed and guard them often for a prolonged period of time. Many mammals are K-selected, and invest more time and energy into their young than do r-selected animals. When two animals mate, they both share an interest in the success of the offspring, though often to different extremes. Mammalian females exhibit some degree of maternal aggression, another example of parental care, which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females; however, some mammals may ""aunt"" the infants of other females, and care for them. Mammalian males may play a role in child rearing, as with tenrecs, however this varies species to species, even within the same genus. For example, the males of the southern pig-tailed macaque (""Macaca nemestrina"") do not participate in child care, whereas the males of the Japanese macaque (""M. fuscata"") do."
H1,18838-Mammal,Humans and other mammals
H1,18838-Mammal,In human culture
PA,18838-Mammal,"Non-human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of millions of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world. Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals. Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals. Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion."
H1,18838-Mammal,Uses and importance
PA,18838-Mammal,"Domestic mammals form a large part of the livestock raised for meat across the world. They include (2009) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1 billion sheep, 1 billion domestic pigs, and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Mammal skins provide leather for shoes, clothing and upholstery. Wool from mammals including sheep, goats and alpacas has been used for centuries for clothing. Mammals serve a major role in science as experimental animals, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year. A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse with an inactivated gene, replaced or disrupted with an artificial piece of DNA. They enable the study of sequenced genes whose functions are unknown. A small percentage of the mammals are non-human primates, used in research for their similarity to humans."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Charles Darwin, Jared Diamond and others have noted the importance of domesticated mammals in the Neolithic development of agriculture and of civilization, causing farmers to replace hunter-gatherers around the world. This transition from hunting and gathering to herding flocks and growing crops was a major step in human history. The new agricultural economies, based on domesticated mammals, caused ""radical restructuring of human societies, worldwide alterations in biodiversity, and significant changes in the Earth's landforms and its atmosphere... momentous outcomes""."
H1,18838-Mammal,Hybrids
PA,18838-Mammal,"Hybrids are offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial)."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Artificial selection, the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals, is being used to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Purebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species."
H1,18838-Mammal,Threats
PA,18838-Mammal,"The loss of species from ecological communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided with the appearance of humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Various species are predicted to become extinct in the near future, among them the rhinoceros, primates, pangolins, and giraffes. Hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around the world. Scientists claim that the growing demand for meat is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon rainforest, are being converted to agricultural land for meat production. According to the World Wildlife Fund's 2016 Living Planet Index, global wildlife populations have declined 58% since 1970, primarily due to habitat destruction, over-hunting and pollution. They project that if current trends continue, 67% of wildlife could disappear by 2020. Another influence is over-hunting and poaching, which can reduce the overall population of game animals, especially those located near villages, as in the case of peccaries. The effects of poaching can especially be seen in the ivory trade with African elephants. Marine mammals are at risk from entanglement from fishing gear, notably cetaceans, with discard mortalities ranging from 65,000 to 86,000 individuals annually."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Attention is being given to endangered species globally, notably through the Convention on Biological Diversity, otherwise known as the Rio Accord, which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats. Another notable conservation organization is the IUCN, which has a membership of over 1,200 governmental and non-governmental organizations."
PA,18838-Mammal,"Recent extinctions can be directly attributed to human influences. The IUCN characterizes 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. Some species, such as the Père David's deer are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther, are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have no impact on the ecosystem. Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, as with the extinction of gray whales in the Atlantic."

PA,12599601-Buzz-Borries,"As a junior halfback for the Navy Midshipmen in 1933, he scored the Midshipmen's sole touchdown to give Navy a 7-0 victory over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish; it was Navy's first victory in the Navy–Notre rivalry series in seven years. In 1934, he helped Navy score its first victory over the Army Black Knights football team since 1921. Against Army, Borries carried the ball 36 times and set up Slade Cutter's field goal for Navy to win 3-0. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American following his 1934 senior season and received the Naval Academy Athletic Association sword during graduation ceremonies."

PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"Spike is sleeping beside his son Tyke when he suddenly wakes up from a bad dream. Spike then comforts his son back to sleep again. No sooner does Tyke doze off then Tom and Jerry enter the scene. Tom runs through a door (literally) and into some spades, rakes and hoes, as Jerry hides among the two dogs. To find Jerry, Tom picks Tyke up to look underneath the puppy, until Spike wakes up and remarks that Tom is holding his son."
PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"Tom holds up his right hand and sees nothing, then holds up his left hand, and drops Tyke in fear. Tom smiles nervously, attempting to run off, until Spike grabs Tom by the whiskers and issues him an ultimatum: the cat ""had better"" leave Tyke alone or Spike will make him suffer the consequences. Tom flees blindly, crashing into a tree, fountain, clothesline pole and trash can."
PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"Jerry emerges from Tyke's ear and walks off casually until Tom comes running back. Jerry takes cover by diving apparently into Spike's mouth, but really under his jowls. Seeing the dog smack his lips as if having eaten the mouse, Tom then places his hand carefully in Spike's mouth while the dog is sleeping, and Jerry emerges from his hiding place and slams the bulldog's jaws shut with Tom's hand still in Spike's mouth. Tom yells in pain and leaps a meter back. Spike wakes up as Tom struggles to get his hand out of his mouth, pulling Spike's teeth out in the process. Tom smiles innocently again, and uses Spike's teeth as castanets while doing a Flamenco dance (to the tune of ""The Mexican Hat Dance"") out of the scene and runs away, leaving the teeth on a nearby bucket."
PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"A few moments later, Tom spies Jerry sleeping next to Tyke, now using the dogs as shields. Hiding behind Tyke's kennel, he reaches out for Jerry. Jerry quietly moves Tyke's tail into Tom's grip, so that Tom ends up grabbing Tyke. After running off with the little pup, Tom realizes his mistake. He turns around to see a sleeping Spike feeling for Tyke. Tom rushes back into Tyke's place, taking on the role of Tyke. To wake up the dog, Jerry then lifts up Tyke's kennel and slams it on Tom's tail. Tom screams in pain, and Spike picks him up and pats him on the back. Just then, Tyke walks back onto the scene and whimpers. Spike looks at Tom suspiciously. Tom duplicates Tyke's whimpering and barking, but accidentally meows when he tries to duplicate his growl. Spike commences to growl at Tom ferociously until Tom clamps his jaws on the dog's nose and runs away, causing Spike to scream. Tom takes a detour to the side, sets up a rake for the dog to run into if he follows him, and then watches as Spike takes the original route. Knowing he's lost his opponent, he runs back through the detour–onto his own rake."
PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"Tom finally realizes that in order to get Jerry, Spike, who is effectively Jerry's shield, must be removed from the picture. He does this by dangling a large piece of steak from a clothesline. A sleeping Spike (who holds a rifle) senses the delectable piece of meat, and sleepwalks after the steak. Jerry, who had tied himself to Tyke as a precautionary measure, sees what Tom is up to. His panicked attempts to wake Spike all fail, and Tom locks Spike in a garden shed. Tom knows that he can now attack Jerry without his overprotective shield."
PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"Tom traps Jerry inside an upturned barrel and hammers a cork into its knothole. However, without Tom noticing, Jerry escapes through the side of the barrel and puts Tyke under the barrel instead. Spike breaks down a wall of the shed and under the impression the cat has been at Tyke again, rushes up to Tom angrily and demands to know where his son is, threatening to skin the cat alive if Tyke is underneath the barrel. Tom confidently starts to lifts up the barrel, thinking it's the mouse, until he hears a whistle, and looks to his side to see that Jerry is lying on a nearby fence, waving to him. Tom does a double gulp, realizing he is put into serious trouble. Spike demands Tom to lift up the barrel. Shivering in fear, Tom nervously begins to lift the barrel, but Spike impatiently swipes it. Tyke is lying underneath it, wiggling his tail at his father. Tom makes a quick exit, into the tree, fountain, and clothesline. Unfortunately, he gets punched by Spike's fist. Then the cat runs off, but before he can flee, Spike corners him and bites & skins him alive."
PA,11141613-Tops-with-Pops,"That night, Tom wears a barrel to cover his total lack of fur (since he was skinned by Spike), and is assigned by Spike to guard them with a baseball bat and looking through a hole in the wall to see his fur being used as a cozy rug by a sleeping Spike, Tyke and Jerry, who hangs a """"DO NOT DISTURB"""" sign on Spike's ear, before snuggling up between Spike and Tyke and falling asleep, ending the cartoon."

PA,18165304-Lew-Perkins,"Perkins served as athletic director at Wichita State University from 1983 to 1987. Perkins took over a program that was on NCAA probation. Two years later, the NCAA cited WSU as having an ""exemplary program."" During his tenure as AD, the WSU football program was ended, due to mounting budget issues.

While Perkins was AD, the football program won the 2008 Orange Bowl, and Kansas basketball brought home the 2008 Men's Basketball Championship. Upon arrival at KU, Perkins became aware of potential NCAA rules violations at KU and he initiated an internal investigation. After KU self-reported violations, the NCAA ruled in 2006 that KU demonstrated a ""lack of institutional control"" under its prior Athletic Director. As a result, Perkins added at least two new full-time compliance officers to the department."
PA,18165304-Lew-Perkins,"Perkins brought many facilities upgrades to the campus, and raised KU's athletics budget from $27 million to over $55 million. $10 million worth of renovations to Allen Fieldhouse were completed in 2005–06, including a new videoboard. Another $15 million was approved for further upgrades to the facility. The Booth Family Hall of Athletics was added to the eastern side of the fieldhouse, at a cost of $5 million. The Anderson Family Football complex officially opened on July 30, 2008 adjacent to the football field at Memorial Stadium, at a cost of $31 million.

PA,18165304-Lew-Perkins,"However, Perkins' time at KU concluded with scandal. In March 2010, KU announced that it was conducting an internal investigation into the Athletics Department ticket office. A separate investigation by the FBI and IRS ultimately resulted in federal charges against five employees of the Athletics Department and one consultant, alleging that they had stolen more than $2 million of KU tickets to be illegally resold during Perkins' tenure. Perkins was not implicated in the scheme, but many of the five employees charged with crimes were hired or promoted to their positions by Perkins. By February 2011, all five employees pleaded guilty to the charges. Separately, in May 2010, Perkins was accused by a former Athletic Department employee of personally accepting exercise equipment in exchange for giving premium basketball tickets. As a result, Perkins was eventually fined by the State of Kansas Ethics Commission for violating rules against accepting gifts."
PA,18165304-Lew-Perkins,"On June 10, 2010, Perkins announced that he would retire after the 2010–11 school year, effective September 4, 2011. However, Perkins soon accelerated this schedule, and one year early, on September 7, 2010, he announced his retirement would be effective immediately. KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little named Associate Athletics Director Sean Lester as interim director for Kansas athletics. Despite the early retirement, KU agreed to pay Perkins the full $2 million salary he would have earned if he had stayed through September 2011, including a $600,000 retention bonus that he would have earned for working at KU through June 2011."

PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"Anne de Vere Chamberlain (; 1883 – 12 February 1967) was the wife of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. A successful businessman when they married, he credited her with encouraging him into political life, and rising to the premiership."
H1,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,Biography
PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"Anne de Vere Cole was born to Major William Utting Cole, of West Woodhay House. Her mother, Mary de Vere, was Irish, and traced her descent to the 15th Earl of Oxford; she inherited Issercleran, Craughwell, County Galway in 1914. Her brother was the noted prankster Horace de Vere Cole (1881–1936), who inherited the family house sometime after 1889; it was later owned by John Huston and then Merv Griffin and is now known as St Cleran's House. From childhood Anne loved to travel, going abroad each year, later going to Canada and East Africa as a married woman. She married Neville Chamberlain in January 1911, and remained his wife until his death in November 1940."
PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"At the time of her marriage her husband, a successful businessman, was already 41 years old, and had expected to remain a bachelor. She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and he was elected to the Birmingham City Council in November 1911. In 1914, just before the outbreak of the Great War, he was made an alderman and the following year was elected Lord Mayor. This marked the beginning of a public career in which Anne Chamberlain was to be Neville's constant companion, helper and trusted colleague, and to share in full his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as MP for the Birmingham constituencies of first Ladywood and then Edgbaston."
PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"The couple had many tastes in common: a love of music and art, of books and flowers (while at 10 Downing Street, she created a bright border where previously there had been some sad London shrubs), and especially of the countryside and wildlife. She would accompany him on his outdoor excursions (though not always the whole way, for he was a prodigious walker), and learned much from his collections and studies of Lepidoptera (butterflies), plants and birds."
PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"In literature she preferred Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, and especially liked works on history, biography and ancient religious rites. Archaeology was also an enduring interest; one of the attractions of Chequers (the prime minister's country retreat) for her was that it lay on the Icknield Way."
PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"In his biography, Keith Feiling wrote:Of what he felt of his debt to his wife, he often spoke in public and, as it had been at Ladywood, so he repeats in a letter of 1937 on becoming Prime Minister: ""I should never have become P.M. if I hadn't had Annie to help me."""
PA,10827489-Anne-Chamberlain,"While living in Edgbaston, the Chamberlains had two children: Dorothy Ethel (1911–1994) and Francis Neville (1914–1965), predeceasing his mother by two years. She was a widow for more than 26 years. Anne Chamberlain is interred in St. Peter's Church, Harborne."

John is carried off in a rocket and lands at the Isle of Phreex, a Jonathan Swift-like asylum for human oddities. There, he befriends Chick the Cherub, the world's first incubator baby, whose gender is never specified.

The process can be defined as, ""...the marriage that integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Operational Support Systems (OSS) entails..."" in a telecommunications company. The goal of a GOS is to open the spreading of information among employees of a company by providing equal access to geographic representation and database information about customers and equipment to ensure the deliverance of services. A Geographical Operations System is meant to provide all employees, from database managers to field technicians and customer service representatives, with equal access to information in order to enhance services and respond to problems. A GOS is adopted by telecommunications companies to combine maps of the company's service area with database information about the company's customers and equipment."

PA,18370097-Geographical-Operations-System,"GOS software relies on a central repository for critical data to foster better communication between the various branches of a telecom. GOS software may offer companies a means to achieve technological convergence in their marketed products. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is utilized to create a discernible pathway for retrieving information from GOS software for a range of employees that may not be familiar with database protocols. The software creates a channel within a company for experts to share information on the various aspects of the telecommunications company, thus opening the spread of information and increasing efficiency for employees."

Technological innovation has introduced greater capacity and capabilities in the telecommunications market, but also added complexity for many companies, as they attempt to develop commercial offerings with an ever-growing list of products and services. A Geographical Operations Systems meshes the importance of Geographical Information Systems – which provides the ability to store data in a geographically-correct map – with the reliance of telecommunications companies on Operational Support Systems as a way to categorize and maintain customer and equipment records."
PA,18370097-Geographical-Operations-System,"The Geographical Operations System simplifies interoperability in a telecommunications company by converging resources that may be stored in different programming languages from across the company into a single software program to be utilized by customer satisfaction representatives, equipment technicians, telecommunications engineers, and the accounting department, among others.

PA,1571632-California-Valley--California,"California Valley is believed to have been visited by Native Americans passing through to the sacred site at Painted Rock, but no permanent Indian settlement existed due to a lack of easily accessible water. California Valley was originally a Spanish land grant, the El Chicote Ranch, that was used for seasonal cattle raising."

The original Spanish land grant was parceled out in 1960 into over 7,200 2.5 acre (10,000 m) sections by optimistic real estate developers. According to their own advertising fliers, these 1960 developers believed that the California State Water Project might bring water to the area. After a more northerly route (closer to Highway 41/46) for the State Water Project was selected, many buyers lost heart, many properties were abandoned and the original developers went bankrupt. Several ranches and other developments built dirt or gravel airstrips and at least one paved runway was built and was at one time listed on aeronautical charts."

H1,193132-Nuclear-family,Nuclear family
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"A nuclear family, elementary family or conjugal family is a family group consisting of two parents and their children (one or more). It is in contrast to a single-parent family, to the larger extended family, and to a family with more than two parents. Nuclear families typically center on a married couple; the nuclear family may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers; some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings, but others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children."
H1,193132-Nuclear-family,Overview
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"Family structures of a married couple and their children were present in Western Europe and New England in the 17th century, influenced by church and theocratic governments. With the emergence of proto-industrialization and early capitalism, the nuclear family became a financially viable social unit. The term ""nuclear family"" first appeared in the early twentieth century. Alternative definitions have evolved to include family units headed by same-sex parents and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role; in the latter case, it also receives the name of conjugal family."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"The concept that narrowly defines a nuclear family is central to stability in modern society that has been promoted by familialists who are social conservatives in the United States, and has been challenged as historically and sociologically inadequate to describe the complexity of actual family relations. In ""Freudian Theories of Identification and Their Derivatives"" Urie Bronfenbrenner states, ""Very little is known about the extent variation in the behavior of fathers and mothers towards sons and daughters, and even less about the possible effects on such differential treatment."" Little is known about how parental behavior and identification processes work, and how children interpret sex role learning. In his theory he uses ""identification"" with the father in the sense that the son will follow the sex role provided by his father and then for the father to be able identify the difference of the ""cross sex"" parent for his daughter."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"Historians Alan Macfarlane and Peter Laslett postulated that nuclear families have been a primary arrangement in England since the 13th century. This primary arrangement was different than the normal arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home. In England multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, ""the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving."" Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries. However, the historicity of the nuclear family in England has been challenged by Cord Oestmann."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"As a fertility factor, single nuclear family households generally have a higher number of children than co-operative living arrangements according to studies from both the Western world and India."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"There have been studies done that shows a difference in the number of children wanted per household according to where they live. Families that live in rural areas wanted to have more kids than families in urban areas. A study done in Japan between October 2011 and February 2012 further researched the effect of area of residence on mean desired number of children. Researchers of the study came to the conclusion that the women living in rural areas with larger families were more likely to want more children, compared to women that lived in urban areas in Japan."
H1,193132-Nuclear-family,Usage of the term
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"Merriam-Webster dates the term back to 1947, while the ""Oxford English Dictionary"" has a reference to the term from 1925; thus it is relatively new."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"In its most common usage, the term ""nuclear family"" refers to a household consisting of a father, a mother and their children all in one household dwelling. George Murdock, an observer of families, offered an early description:"
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"Many individuals are part of two nuclear families in their lives: the family of origin in which they are offspring, and the family of procreation in which they are a parent."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"While the phrase dates approximately from the Atomic Age, the term ""nuclear"" is not used here in the context of nuclear warfare or nuclear power, but instead originates in the same way as nuclear fission, from the noun ""nucleus"", itself originating in the Latin ""nux"", meaning ""nut"", i.e. the core of something – thus, the nuclear family refers to all members of the family being part of the same core rather than directly to atomic weapons."
H1,193132-Nuclear-family,Compared with extended family
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"An extended family group consists of non-nuclear (or ""non-immediate"") family members considered together with nuclear (or ""immediate"") family members. When extended family is involved they also influence children's development just as much as the parents would on their own. In an extended family resources are usually shared among those involved adding more of a community aspect to the family unit. This is not just talking about sharing money and physical thing but includes sharing time for example extended family such as grandparents can watch over their grandchildren allowing parents to continue and pursue careers and creating a healthy and supportive environment the children to grow up in and allows the parents to have much less stress. Extended families help keep the kids in the family healthier because of all the resources the kids get now that they have other individuals able to help them and support them as they grow up."
LI,193132-Nuclear-family,Changes to family formation
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"In 2005, information from the United States Census Bureau showed that 70% of children in the US live in two-parent families, with 66% of those living with parents who were married, and 60% living with their biological parents. The information also explained that ""the figures suggest that the tumultuous shifts in family structure since the late 1960s have leveled off since 1990""."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"When considered separately from couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children, the United States nuclear families appear to constitute a minority of households – with a rising prevalence of other family arrangements. In 2000, nuclear families with the original biological parents constituted roughly 24.10% of American households, compared with 40.30% in 1970. Roughly two-thirds of all children in the United States will spend at least some time in a single-parent household. According to some sociologists, ""[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today."" (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced, ""postmodern family"", intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children."" Nuclear family households are now less common compared to household with couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"In the UK, the number of nuclear families fell from 39.0% of all households in 1968 to 28.0% in 1992. The decrease accompanied an equivalent increase in the number of single-parent households and in the number of adults living alone."

(Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced, ""postmodern family"", intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children."""
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"Professor Wolfgang Haak of Adelaide University, detects traces of the nuclear family in prehistoric Central Europe. A 2005 archeological dig in Elau in Germany, analyzed by Haak, revealed genetic evidence suggesting that the 13 individuals found in a grave were closely related. Haak said, ""By establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave, we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in Central Europe... Their unity in death suggest[s] a unity in life."" This paper does not regard the nuclear family as ""natural"" or as the only model for human family life. ""This does not establish the elemental family to be a universal model or the most ancient institution of human communities. For example, polygamous unions are prevalent in ethnographic data and models of household communities have apparently been involving a high degree of complexity from their origins."" In this study evidence suggests that the nuclear family was embedded with an extended family. The remains of three children (probably siblings based on DNA evidence) were found buried with a woman who was not their mother but may have been an ""aunt or a step-mother""."
LI,193132-Nuclear-family,North American conservatism
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"For social conservatism in the United States and Canada, the idea that the nuclear family is traditional is an important aspect, where family is seen as the primary unit of society. These movements oppose alternative family forms and social institutions that are seen by them to undermine parental authority. The numbers of nuclear families is slowly dwindling in the US as more women pursue higher education, develop professional lives, and delay having children until later in their life. Children and marriage have become less appealing as many women continue to face societal, familial, and/or peer pressure to give up their education and successful career to focus on stabilizing the home. As diversity in the United States continues to increase, it is becoming difficult for the classically traditional family unit—a heterosexual couple of the same race and ethnicity with two children—to stay the norm, calling the relevancy of North American Conservatism into question. Data from 2014 also suggests that single parents and the likelihood of children living with one is also determined by race. Pew Research Center has found that 54% of African-American individuals will be single parents compared to 19% of Caucasian individuals.Several factors account for the differences in family structure including economic and social class. Differences in education level also change the amount of single parents. In 2014, those with less than a high school education are 46% more likely to be a single parent compared to 12% who have graduated from college."
PA,193132-Nuclear-family,"Critics of the term ""traditional family"" point out that in most cultures and at most times, the extended family model has been most common, not the nuclear family, though it has had a longer tradition in England than in other parts of Europe and Asia which contributed large numbers of immigrants to the Americas. The nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s."

When production completed, the baseball diamond created for the movie was left behind. Most of the baseball field, including the diamond and the adjacent house, was on one farm owned by the Lansing family, but the left and center field were on an adjacent property owned by the Ameskamp family. The field was built on the two properties because the producers wanted the field in a location where sunset shots would be uninhibited."

The Ameskamp family returned their land to farming for a year, but then restored the remainder of the field and opened up their own souvenir stand. The two owners had operated separate tourist facilities and had also been at odds regarding commercialization of the site."

The team's presence at the field on Sunday afternoons once a month attracted thousands of additional fans to the field. In 1991 and 1992, the Upper Deck Company sponsored a celebrity game at the field. Executive producer Tony Loiacono, who later received the key to the city, brought Hall of Famers like Bob Gibson, Reggie Jackson and Bob Feller to take on Hollywood stars like Kelsey Grammer and Meatloaf in a charity game.

PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"Robert Alvin Lewis (October 18, 1917 – June 18, 1983) was a United States Army Air Forces officer serving in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. He was the co-pilot of the ""Enola Gay"", the B-29 Superfortress bomber which dropped the atomic bomb Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945."
H1,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,Military career
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"Lewis grew up in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, and attended Ridgefield Park High School, graduating in 1937. During World War II, he had to wait after enlisting to be processed into the USAAF Officer Candidate School (OCS). Lewis went on to be a multi-engine test pilot in B-24, B-26, B-17 and B-29 bombers, which later led to him as co-pilot and his crew being selected for the Hiroshima bombing mission."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"Lewis was field promoted to captain by General Curtis LeMay after demonstrating the B-29 and training the general on how to fly it. LeMay addressed Lieutenant Lewis as ""Captain Lewis"" on the field at the conclusion of several days of training and testing. Lewis tried to correct the general as to his rank, but LeMay insisted on captain, with the field commission arriving several weeks later by USAAF mail to him based in the midwestern US at the time."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"Lewis was always a ""crew-first"" pilot who survived two crashes due to electrical failure and engine failure. Articles from New York City area newspapers attested to his ""cool head under stressful conditions"", ultimately leading to his selection as captain of a B-29 crew. Lewis led hundreds of bombing runs from Utah to Salton Sea in California leading up to his selection with his crew by Colonel Paul Tibbets. In early June, Lewis and his co-pilot Dick McNamara flew the entire crew and support crew from Utah to Tinian, in the B-29 specially modified to carry Little Boy to Japan from the huge Tinian base that General LeMay controlled from Guam."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"On August 6, 1945 – August 5 in the United States, due to the time difference – Lewis was the co-pilot of the ""Enola Gay"" when it dropped Little Boy on Hiroshima. Normally the aircraft commander assigned to the ""Enola Gay"", for this important mission he acted as co-pilot, assisting ""Enola Gay""'s new aircraft commander, Colonel Tibbets. Lewis and his crew, minus their original co-pilot Dick McNamara, were Tibbet's crew for the mission, and it included two specialists for the arming of Little Boy, the uranium-235 fission bomb."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"The entire story was written by Lewis just before his death in 1983. His log, the only minute-by-minute recording on paper by any crew member that day, is part of his copyrighted historical manuscript. His sons and daughter are in the process of publishing the manuscript before the 75th anniversary of the bombing in 2020."
H1,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,Post-war
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"After the war, Lewis became a pilot for American Overseas Airlines, specializing in the New York to London routes. He left in 1947 to rejoin his prewar employer, the Henry Heide Candy Company, where he became plant manager and personnel director of their factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was granted at least three patents during his time at Heide. In the 1950s, Lewis lived with his family in a home that he had built in Old Tappan, New Jersey. He and his wife had a daughter and four sons."
H1,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,Survivor meetings
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"In New York City in 1951, Lewis met Hiroshima survivor Father Hubert Schiffer, who was eight blocks from ground zero when the explosion occurred and was seriously injured. Schiffer invited Lewis to visit Hiroshima in August 1952 for the dedication of a ""palace of prayer"", which Lewis accepted; however, there is no record of Lewis actually making such a visit. The two also appeared together at Fordham University in 1957, on the twelfth anniversary of the bombing, with Schiffer noting that they had become ""very fast friends."""
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"In 1955, Lewis appeared on the television show ""This is Your Life"", in an episode not without controversy. The show had as its guest Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who had been living in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing and survived the explosion, as recounted in John Hersey's 1946 book ""Hiroshima"". Tanimoto had traveled to the United States with the Hiroshima Maidens to get reconstructive surgery for them, and while there was the subject of the May 11 episode of ""This Is Your Life."" After some acquaintances were introduced and interviewed, a surprise for Tanimoto was meeting Lewis – on live television broadcast to a nationwide audience – representing the crew of the aircraft that had so dramatically changed his life. Contemporary reaction to the episode was mixed, ranging from ""one of [the] best"" to a ""new low in poor taste."" Lewis described the ""Enola Gay""'s flight and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. When asked by host Ralph Edwards if he remembered his reaction on that fateful day, he remarked, ""I wrote down later, 'My God, what have we done?' """
H1,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,Later life
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"Lewis became a self-taught stone sculptor, working in marble and alabaster, following a business trip to Florence where he saw some apprentices at work. One of his sculptures, titled ""‘God’s Wind’ at Hiroshima?"", depicted a mushroom cloud. In the 1970s, Lewis lived in a small cottage on West Shore Trail in the quiet Lake Mohawk community of Sparta, New Jersey."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"In 1971, Lewis sold his manuscript log from the Hiroshima mission, which he had written during the flight at the request of journalist William L. Laurence; it was auctioned by Christies and sold for $37,000. The manuscript was later resold to Malcolm Forbes, and after Forbes' death was purchased by an anonymous buyer. Prior to the 1971 sale, Lewis made six hand-written copies of the log, one each for his wife and five children; one copy was sold in 2015 for $50,000."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"In 1975, Lewis took a position with the Estee Candy Corporation, until his retirement in 1981. He was portrayed by Gregory Harrison in the 1980 television film ""Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb"". Lewis lived in Smithfield, Virginia, for two years before his death in 1983 of a heart attack at home; he was declared dead at Riverside Hospital in Newport News, Virginia."
PA,14443948-Robert-A--Lewis,"In 1990, Lewis' widow put up for auction a manuscript navigator's log from the Hiroshima mission, however it failed to sell after questions arose about its authenticity, with ""Enola Gay"" navigator Theodore Van Kirk stating that he still had the log he wrote during the mission."

H1,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,Doctrine of foreign equivalents
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"The doctrine of foreign equivalents is a rule applied in United States trademark law which requires courts and the TTAB to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the use of terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language."
H1,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,Test applied
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"The Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (""TMEP"") states the test for applying the doctrine of foreign equivalents is ""whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent"". With respect to descriptive or generic marks, the TMEP specifies that in determining whether a foreign term is entitled to registration, ""[t]he test is whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would have a descriptive or generic connotation"". However, ""foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes."" This test is also applied by courts to determine ""whether that foreign word would be descriptive of the product to that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language."""
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"It is unclear whether the test differs for asserted cases of likelihood of confusion. The Federal Circuit has recently clarified the applicability of the doctrine of foreign equivalents in likelihood of confusion cases, stating that ""When it is unlikely that an American buyer will translate the foreign mark and will take it as it is, then the doctrine of foreign equivalents will not be applied"". The court noted that ""the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule and should be viewed merely as a guideline"". Instead ""[t]he doctrine should be applied only when it is likely that the ordinary American purchaser would ""stop and translate [the word] into its English equivalent"". The Federal Circuit specifically found that ""it is improbable that the average American purchaser would stop and translate 'VEUVE' into 'widow'""."
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"The ""Palm Bay Imports"" case suggests that it is the same test stating ""[u]nder the doctrine of foreign equivalents, foreign words from common languages are translated into English to determine genericness, descriptiveness, as well as similarity of connotation in order to ascertain confusing similarity with English word marks."""
LI,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,The Ordinary American Purchaser
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"As noted above, in Palm Bay, the Federal Circuit held that the doctrine of foreign equivalents only applies when the ""ordinary American purchaser"" is likely to translate the foreign mark"
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"into English. A short time after ""Palm Bay"" was decided, the T.T.A.B. interpreted ""ordinary American purchaser"" in ""In re Thomas"" and held that the ordinary American purchaser includes only purchasers ""familiar with the foreign language."" This narrow definition of ""ordinary American purchaser"" effectively guaranteed that the doctrine would be applied in nearly every case involving a foreign word since ""those proficient in a non-English language . . . would ordinarily be expected to translate words into English."""
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"At its next opportunity, however, the Federal Circuit abrogated ""Thomas"" in part. In In re Spirits International, a geographic deceptiveness case, the Federal Circuit held that the ordinary American purchaser """"includes all American purchasers"", including those proficient in a non-English language."""
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"However, because the ""Spirits"" court limited its ruling to the doctrine's application with respect to the geographic deceptiveness bar, the Board currently applies the ""Spirits"" definition of ordinary American purchaser in cases of geographic deceptiveness refusals and the ""Thomas"" definition to all other bars."
H1,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,Status of words in foreign countries
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"Cases have noted that the status accorded to words in foreign countries has no bearing on the registration of marks in the U.S. For example, in ""Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co."", the court rejected as irrelevant the generic usage of the phrase ""L.A. beer"" in Australia for low alcohol beer. In ""Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten"", the court stated that ""[w]hile plaintiff has sought to show that Seiko is a generic term in Japanese, it is not so recognized in this country. Accordingly, the mark must still be regarded as arbitrary and fanciful in the United States."""
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"Furthermore, ""[a] number of cases hold that a term may be generic in one country and suggestive in another"". In ""Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc."", a court rejected as irrelevant the generic use of the term ""Greengrocer"" in Britain for a retailer of fruit. The defendant argued that the trademark ""Greengrocer"", which is a generic term in Britain for a retailer of fruits and vegetables, was not entitled to protection as a trademark in the United States. The court rejected this argument on the ground that it is irrelevant how a term is used outside the United States: ""The parties agree that the term is generic in Britain. Since we deal here with American trademark law, and thus American consumers, neither British usage nor the dictionary definition indicating such usage are determinative."""
H1,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,Dead and obscure languages
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"TMEP § 1209.03(g) expresses the caveat that ""foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes."" Emphasis added. ""Descriptiveness is evaluated according to 'that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language.'"" General Cigar Co. v. G.D.M. Inc., 988 F. Supp. 647, 660 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (quoting 1 McCarthy § 11.14, p. 464-65). In that case, the court found that the strength of the Cohiba mark was not diminished by the fact that Cohiba is the Taino Indian word for tobacco, because the Taino language was an obscure language. The court noted:"
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"Nevertheless, cases exist where trademark registration has been rejected for a word that was generic or descriptive when translated from a language such as Latin or Ancient Greek."
H1,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,Transliterations versus translations
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"Where a word is a foreign transliteration of an English mark, the TTAB has held that there is nothing to translate, and the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not invoked. In ""Green Spot (Thailand) Ltd. v. Vitasoy Int'l Holdings Ltd."", the TTAB considered the application of the doctrine where Green Spot sought to register ""Vitamilk"", and was opposed by Vitasoy, which was the owner of a senior registration. Green Spot also owned a mark in Chinese characters for which the first sets of characters were transliterations of ""vi"" and ""ta"" with no meaning in Chinese, while the third, 奶 (nai) was the Chinese word for ""milk"". Green Spot argued that its senior Chinese character mark was the equivalent of Vitamilk, and that Green Spot's ownership of the senior mark gave it the right to own the equivalent English mark. The TTAB refused to apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents, because the transliterations of ""vi"" and ""ta"" had no actual translation from Chinese to English."
H1,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,Criticism
PA,15496054-Doctrine-of-foreign-equivalents,"The doctrine has been criticized in recent years. Commentators have noted that courts have ""reached irreconcilable holdings"" in applying the doctrine. It has also been suggested that the doctrine be abolished."

PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"Edmond Edward Wysinger (1816–1891) was an African American pioneer in California, arriving around October 1849 at the beginning of the California Gold Rush."
H1,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,California Supreme Court case
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"On January 29, 1890, in the Visalia, California court case ""Wysinger vs. Crookshank"", 82 Cal 588, 720, (1890), the California Supreme Court ruled that public school districts in California may not establish separate schools for children of African descent."
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"In 1862, Visalia was a community deeply divided by the American Civil War (1861–1865) and many sided with the South. Despite the turmoil, Wysinger stayed in the community. Wysinger, a self-educated man, worked as a laborer and part-time preacher. He stressed the importance of education for his children. He tried to admit his son Arthur to a regular public school but was refused, resulting in him entering a suit against the county school board of education in the Supreme Court of the State California in October 1888. On March 1, 1890, the California Supreme Court, in ""Wysinger vs. Crookshank"" reversed a lower court decision and ordered that 12-year-old Arthur Wysinger be admitted to Visalia's regular school system."
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"If the people of the state desired separate but equal schools for citizens of African descent, and Indians, their wish may be accomplished by laws enacted by the law-making department of the government in accordance with existing constitutional provisions. But this course had not been pursued, as the law stood in 1890, and the powers given to boards of education and school trustees, under section 1617 of the Political Code, did not include the right claimed by the board of education of Visalia. The laws segregating Chinese children, (see United States v. Wong Kim Ark), remained on the books probably because it was the general impression that only discriminatory laws aimed at African Americans and Indians were forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution."
H1,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,Biography
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"Wysinger was one of the first African Americans to migrate to California from the American South. He was born in 1816, the offspring of a Cherokee woman and a black man."
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"In the early part of 1849, at the age of 32, Wysinger and his German owner made the long perilous trip through Indian territory by ox-team Conestoga wagon to Grass Valley, California, by way of Donner Pass, arriving around October 1849 — the height of the California Gold Rush. Wysinger took on the last name of his slave owner; his original Indian name was Bush."
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"After arriving in the northern mine area of California's Mother Lode Gold Belt, Wysinger with a group of 100 or more African American miners, were surface mining in and around Morman, Mokelumne Hill, at Placerville and Grass Valley. Mokelumne Hill was called ""Moke Hill"". This region was first inhabited by a tribe of Miwok Native Americans who were called ""Mokelumne"", which means people of Mokel. ""Moke Hill"" began to grow after gold was discovered in 1848. Place names like Negro Hill, Negro Bar (a large sand bar located on the south bank of the lower American River) and Negro Flat attest to the presence of blacks in California. Wysinger mined at Mokelumne, Murphy's Camp, Diamond and Mud Springs, Grass Valley, Negro Bar and elsewhere in the mining districts of California. It took him about a year to buy his freedom for $1,000."
PA,12063267-Edmond-Edward-Wysinger,"In 1853, Alfred and Susan Hines Wilson, arrived in Miles Creek in Mariposa County, California, from Wayne County in Missouri, going first to Texas then to California by way of ox-team. There were more than a 100 wagons in the ox-driven team lasting from March to December 1853. In Merced, Edmond Wysinger met and married their daughter,"

H1,16017683-Food-Programme,The Programme
PA,16017683-Food-Programme,"Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, told the November 1981 Central Committee plenum that work had begun on a new food programme. on 24 May 1982 Brezhnev told a Central Committee plenum that the goal of the new Food Programme was to enhance, and improve, productivity and output of Soviet agriculture. The basic elements of the planning mechanism and its administrative and organisational features of Soviet agriculture remained unchanged. The bureaucracy was reorganised to improve efficiency by establishing new institutions and investing more money on agriculture in the form of procurement prices. The Soviet Government would build roads, cultural facilities and consumer services close to unproductive farms to increase their productivity. This increased expenditure amounted to 30 billion rubles in 1983, and food subsidy on meat, milk, bread and potatoes increased by around 51 million rubles. In other words, when a Soviet consumer bought agricultural products, it would be less than half of what the Soviet Government invested on transporting the goods from the farms to the consumer facilities. The Food Programme was initiated in 1982 and would end in 1990 at the end of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan."
PA,16017683-Food-Programme,"Mikhail Gorbachev, the then Central Committee Secretary Responsible for Agriculture, tried to establish nationwide committees which would oversee the reform's implementation. Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, objected to this, believing that the central ministries were fit to handle the reform's implementation themselves. According to Martin McCauley, the author behind ""Gorbachev"", Tikhonov objected because he believed Gorbachev was trying to take his place as Council of Ministers chairman."
PA,16017683-Food-Programme,"During Brezhnev's November 1981 speech many Sovietologists thought that the Food Programme would decrease bureaucratic interference in Soviet agriculture. This, as was later proven, was far from the intended goal. While he did talk about ""strengthening"" the collective and state farms, he never said he would allow them to decide what to produce and how to produce it for instance. Instead of giving the farmers more independence, Brezhnev announced the establishment of two new bureaucratic layers. The first, the Agro-Industrial Associations, at the district, territory, province and autonomous level of governance would function as a ""full-fledged and democratic management agency"". Industrial commissions were established at the republic and union level."
H1,16017683-Food-Programme,Fulfillment
PA,16017683-Food-Programme,"The Food Programme, which was ridiculed in the First World, increased grain yields between 1981 and 1986 by 3.4 percent, an increase from 1.9 percent for the period of 1965 to 1980. Agricultural output decreased in the period of 1986 to 1990, making the fulfillment of the Food Programme's goals unattainable."

PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,"William Hazledine (1763 – 26 October 1840) was an English ironmaster. Establishing large foundries, he was a pioneer in casting structural ironwork, most notably for canal aqueducts and early suspension bridges. Many of these projects were collaborations with Thomas Telford, including the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and the Menai Suspension Bridge."

He and his brother John were trained as millwrights by their uncle. (Later, John and younger brothers Robert and Thomas set up an ironworks in Bridgnorth, Shropshire)."

(Several years later he leased the forge; it became an important source of wrought iron for later projects.) He moved to Shrewsbury, and about 1787 entered into partnership with Robert Webster, a clockmaker and inventor. They set up a foundry in Cole Hall, near the Welsh Bridge in Shrewsbury. In 1789 he joined the Freemasons; he met there a fellow member, Thomas Telford. Hazledine's earliest recorded ironwork was in 1792 for St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, built by John Simpson, a friend of Hazledine and associate of Telford: cast iron columns were made to support the upper gallery of the church."
PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,"The partnership with Webster was dissolved, and in 1793 he purchased land at Coleham in Shrewsbury, where he set up a larger foundry with steam-powered equipment. The foundry eventually employed several hundred workers. In 1796 he cast the frame for the Ditherington Flax Mill designed by Charles Bage. It was the world's first iron-framed building."

PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,In the following years Hazledine supplied ironwork for many projects of Thomas Telford.
PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,"He made the iron deck for the Chirk Aqueduct, completed in 1802. He built a large foundry at Plas Kynaston, Cefn Mawr, where he made the iron deck for the nearby Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, completed in 1805."
PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,"The Bonar Bridge in Scotland, an innovative design by Telford with a central span of , was built in 1811–12; The ironwork was cast at Plas Kynaston, and Hazledine supervised its erection. There were several more bridges of this design, including the Mythe Bridge, with a span of , at Tewkesbury (1823–26)."
PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,From about 1815 to 1820 he supplied and fitted lock gates for the western half of Telford's Caledonian Canal.
PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,"In 1821 Hazledine contracted to supply the wrought iron and cast iron for the Menai Suspension Bridge. The bridge, designed by Telford, was completed in 1826. He also supplied the ironwork for Telford's Conwy Suspension Bridge, completed the same year. The tensile strength of the wrought iron chains, made at Upton Forge, was important to these suspension bridges."

PA,17256465-William-Hazledine,"in 1817 he took over Calcutts Ironworks, in Ironbridge Gorge; pig iron was produced, and wrought and cast iron made. It was not successful, and he gave up the lease in 1831. Other business interests included a limeworks at Llanymynech, property in Shrewsbury, and timber-yards and brickyards."

H1,10414501-Platinum-black,Platinum black
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,Platinum black (Pt black) is a fine powder of platinum with good catalytic properties. The name of platinum black is due to its black color.
H1,10414501-Platinum-black,Uses
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Thin film electrode
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Platinum black is widely used as a thin film covering solid platinum metal, forming platinum electrodes for applications in electrochemistry. The process of covering platinum electrodes with such a layer of platinum black is called ""platinization of platinum"". The platinized platinum has a true surface area much higher than the geometrical surface area of the electrode and, therefore, exhibits action superior to that of shiny platinum."
H1,10414501-Platinum-black,Fuel cell membrane catalyst
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Platinum black powder is used as a catalyst in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. In common practice, the platinum black is either sprayed using an ultrasonic nozzle or hot pressed onto the membrane or gas diffusion layer. A suspension of platinum black and carbon powder in ethanol-water solutions serves to optimize the uniformity of the coating, electrical conductivity, and in the case of application to the membrane, to prevent dehydration of the membrane during the application."
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Catalytic ignition of flammable gasses
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Historically many ""self-lighting"" gas lamps, ovens, and stove burners used platinum black to catalyze the oxidation of a small amount of gas, lighting the device without a match or spark. This works particularly well for producer gas, town gas, and wood gas which contain a substantial fraction of hydrogen gas (H) which is particularly well catalyzed by platinum black."
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Manufacturing of platinum black powder
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Platinum black powder can be manufactured from ammonium chloroplatinate by heating at 500 °C in molten sodium nitrate for 30 minutes, followed by pouring the melt into water, boiling, washing, and reduction of the brown powder (believed to be platinum dioxide) with gaseous hydrogen to platinum black."
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Process of platinization of platinum metal
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Before platinization, the platinum surface is cleaned by immersion in aqua regia (50% solution, i.e., 3 volumes of 12 mol/kg of HCl, 1 volume of 16 mol/kg HNO, 4 volumes of water)."
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Platinization is often conducted from water solution of 0.072 mol/kg of chloroplatinic acid and 0.00013 mol/kg of lead acetate, at a current density of 30 mA/cm for up to 10 minutes. The process evolves chlorine at the anode; the interaction of the chlorine with the cathode is prevented by employing a suitable separation (e.g., a glass frit)."
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,Another author recommends electroplating with the current density of 5 mA/cm while reversing the polarity every 30 seconds for 15 minutes.
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"After platinization, the electrode should be rinsed and stored in distilled water. The electrode loses its catalytic properties on prolonged exposure to air."
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Platinum metal sponge
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"Platinum sponge is a porous, grayish-black form of platinum that can adsorb a large amount of gas, such as hydrogen or oxygen gas, allowing it to be used as a catalyst in many gas reactions such as the oxidation of ammonium. It can also be used for the ignition of combustible gases. It is used as the raw material for electronic instrument, chemical industry, and precision alloys. It can also be used as a surface active agent. It is soluble in chloroazotic acid and is formed from a mass of metallic particles."
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,It is made of a mass of platinum particles with the following characteristics:
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Platinum (Pt) content：≥99.9%

PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"It is prepared by dipping asbestos into chloroplatinic acid or ammonium chloroplatinate. The substance is then burned to produce platinum sponge. Alternatively, it can be made by strongly heating ammonium chloroplatinate. Its catalytic properties vary depending on the specifics of the manufacturing."
LI,10414501-Platinum-black,Potential of platinized platinum versus shiny platinum
PA,10414501-Platinum-black,"In hydrogen saturated hydrochloric acid, the shiny platinum electrode is observed to assume positive potential versus that of platinum black at zero net current (+ 340 mV at room temperature). With the temperature increasing to 70 °C, the difference in potentials dropped to zero. The reason for this is not perfectly clear, although several explanations have been proposed."

H1,183515-Retail,Brief
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term ""retailer"" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of a large number of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than ""rude booths"" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era."
PA,183515-Retail,"Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. Digital technologies are also changing the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts – from strip shopping centres in residential streets through to large, indoor shopping malls. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order."
H1,183515-Retail,Etymology
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail comes from the Old French word ""tailler"", which means ""to cut off, clip, pare, divide"" in terms of tailoring (1365). It was first recorded as a noun with the meaning of a ""sale in small quantities"" in 1433 (from the Middle French ""retail"", ""piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring""). As in the French, the word, ""retail"", in both Dutch and German, also refers to the sale of small quantities of items."
H1,183515-Retail,Definition and explanation
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail refers to the activity of selling goods or services directly to consumers or end-users. Some retailers may sell to business customers, and such sales are termed ""non-retail activity."" In some jurisdictions or regions, legal definitions of retail specify that at least 80 percent of sales activity must be to end-users."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retailing often occurs in retail stores or service establishments, but may also occur through direct selling such as through vending machines, door-to-door sales or electronic channels."
PA,183515-Retail,"Although the idea of retail is often associated with the purchase of goods, the term may be applied to service-providers that sell to consumers. Retail service providers include retail banking, tourism, insurance, private healthcare, private education, private security firms, legal firms, publishers, public transport and others. For example, a tourism provider might have a retail division that books travel and accommodation for consumers plus a wholesale division that purchases blocks of accommodation, hospitality, transport and sightseeing which are subsequently packaged into a holiday tour for sale to retail travel agents."
PA,183515-Retail,"Some retailers badge their stores as ""wholesale outlets"" offering ""wholesale prices."" While this practice may encourage consumers to imagine that they have access to lower prices, while being prepared to trade-off reduced prices for cramped in-store environments, in a strict legal sense, a store that sells the majority of its merchandise direct to consumers, is defined as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Different jurisdictions set parameters for the ratio of consumer to business sales that define a retail business."
H1,183515-Retail,History
H1,183515-Retail,Retailing in antiquity
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail markets have existed since ancient times. Archaeological evidence for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates back more than 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying is thought to have emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th millennium BCE. Gharipour points to evidence of primitive shops and trade centres in Sialk Hills in Kashan (6000 BCE), Catalk Huyuk in modern-day Turkey (7,500–5,700 BCE), Jericho (2600 BCE) and Susa (4000 BCE). Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia and Egypt. These markets typically occupied a place in the town's centre. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied permanent premises in alleys that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days. In ancient Greece markets operated within the agora, an open space where, on market days, goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls. In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front. In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace."
PA,183515-Retail,"The Phoenicians, noted for their seafaring skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by the 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier to learn that the complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region. Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa."
PA,183515-Retail,"In the Graeco-Roman world, the market primarily served the local peasantry. Local producers, who were generally poor, would sell small surpluses from their individual farming activities, purchase minor farm equipment and also buy a few luxuries for their homes. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting and importing. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies. The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places: oysters from Londinium, cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the middle East. Markets were also important centres of social life."
PA,183515-Retail,"The rise of retailing and marketing in England and Europe has been extensively studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere. Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems. From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE. Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite. The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and sophisticated brand concepts."
LI,183515-Retail,Retailing in Medieval Europe
PA,183515-Retail,"In Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. In 13th century London, mercers and haberdashers were known to exist and grocers sold ""miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines"" but fish and other perishables were sold through markets, costermongers, hucksters, peddlers or other type of itinerant vendor."
PA,183515-Retail,"In the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. In Chester, a medieval covered shopping arcade represented a major innovation that attracted shoppers from many miles around. Known as ""The Rows"" this medieval shopping arcade is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe. Fragments of Chester's Medieval Row, which is believed to date to the mid-13th century, can still be found in Cheshire. In the 13th or 14th century, another arcade with several shops was recorded at ""Drapery Row"" in Winchester. The emergence of street names such as ""Drapery Row"", ""Mercer's Lane"" and ""Ironmonger Lane"" in the medieval period suggests that permanent shops were becoming more commonplace."
PA,183515-Retail,"Medieval shops had little in common with their modern equivalent. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than ""rude booths"" and their owners ""bawled as loudly as the itinerants."" Shopfronts typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard. Cox and Dannehl suggest that the Medieval shopper's experience was very different. Glazed windows, which were rare during the medieval period, and did not become commonplace until the eighteenth century, meant that shop interiors were dark places. Outside the markets, goods were rarely out on display and the service counter was unknown. Shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers."
PA,183515-Retail,"Outside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs. Markets were held daily in the more populous towns and cities or weekly in the more sparsely populated rural districts. Markets sold fresh produce; fruit, vegetables, baked goods, meat, poultry, fish and some ready to eat foodstuffs; while fairs operated on a periodic cycle and were almost always associated with a religious festival. Fairs sold non-perishables such as farm tools, homewares, furniture, rugs and ceramics. Market towns dotted the medieval European landscape while itinerant vendors supplied less populated areas or hard-to-reach districts. Peddlers and other itinerant vendors operated alongside other types of retail for centuries. The political philosopher, John Stuart Mill compared the convenience of markets/fairs to that of the itinerant peddlers:"
PA,183515-Retail,"Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns across Europe, and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns. Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century the Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas."
PA,183515-Retail,"English market towns were regulated from a relatively early period. The English monarchs awarded a ""charter"" to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. This charter would grant the lords the right to take tolls and also afford some protection from rival markets. For example, once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers' perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to make their purchases and which markets were superior. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic market charters."
PA,183515-Retail,"Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances – grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and woollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar – calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World."
PA,183515-Retail,"English essayist, Joseph Addison, writing in 1711, described the exotic origin of produce available to English society in the following terms:"
PA,183515-Retail,"Luca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza’s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called ‘resellers’ (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild. Cheesemongers’ shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers."
H1,183515-Retail,"Retailing in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries"
PA,183515-Retail,"By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold general merchandise, much like a contemporary convenience store or a general store. For example, William Allen, a mercer in Tamworth who died in 1604, sold spices alongside furs and fabrics. William Stout of Lancaster retailed sugar, tobacco, nails and prunes at both his shop and at the central markets. His autobiography reveals that he spent most of his time preparing products for sale at the central market, which brought an influx of customers into town."
PA,183515-Retail,"As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Glazing was widely used from the early 18th-century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed, Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted that ""Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now."""
PA,183515-Retail,"Outside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the ""riff raff."" One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls."
PA,183515-Retail,"Savitt has argued that by the eighteenth century, American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialise in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions."
PA,183515-Retail,"By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due its lack of pavement for pedestrians. Retailers, eager to attract window shoppers by providing a shopping environment away from the filthy streets, began to construct rudimentary arcades. Opening in 1771, the ""Coliseé"", situated on the Champs Elysee, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. For Parisians, the location was seen as too remote and the arcade closed within two years of opening. Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked the ends of the Palais Royal, opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life."
PA,183515-Retail,"The architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as ""l’Ère des passages couverts"" (the Arcade Era). In the European capitals, shopping arcades spread across the continent, reaching their heyday in the early 19th century: the Palais Royal in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799. London's Piccadilly Arcade (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (1878). Designed to attract the genteel middle class, arcade retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements, and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth century pass-time for the emerging middle classes. The ""Illustrated Guide to Paris"" of 1852 summarized the appeal of arcades in the following description:"
PA,183515-Retail,"The Palais-Royal, which opened to Parisians in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades. The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building. London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset. Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall."
PA,183515-Retail,"While the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. John Stuart Mill wrote about the rise of the co-operative retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-nineteenth century. Stuart Mill locates these co-operative stores within a broader co-operative movement which was prominent in the industrial city of Manchester and in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. He documents one of the early co-operative retail stores in Rochdale in Manchester, England, ""In 1853, the Store purchased for £745, a warehouse (freehold) on the opposite side of the street, where they keep and retail their stores of flour, butcher's meat, potatoes, and kindred articles."" Stuart Mill also quoted a contemporary commentator who wrote of the benefits of the co-operative store:"
PA,183515-Retail,"Buyer and seller meet as friends; there is no overreaching on one side, and no suspicion on the other... These crowds of humble working men, who never knew before when they put good food in their mouths, whose every dinner was adulterated, whose shoes let in the water a month too soon, whose waistcoats shone with devil's dust, and whose wives wore calico that would not wash, now buy in the markets like millionaires, and as far as pureness of food goes, live like lords."
H1,183515-Retail,Retailing in the modern era
PA,183515-Retail,"The modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st-century. In major cities, the department store emerged in the mid to late 19th-century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. The term, ""department store"" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops. In London, the first department stores appeared in Oxford Street and Regent Street, where they formed part of a distinctly modern shopping precinct. When London draper, William Whiteley attempted to transform his Bayswater drapery store into a department store by adding a meat and vegetable department and an Oriental Department in around 1875, he met with extreme resistance from other shop-keepers, who resented that he was encroaching on their territory and poaching their customers. Before long, however, major department stores began to open across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid-nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; Le Bon Marché of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905. Other twentieth century innovations in retailing included chain stores, mail-order, multi-level marketing (pyramid selling or network marketing, 1920s), party plans ( 1930s) and B2C e-commerce."
PA,183515-Retail,"Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East."
PA,183515-Retail,"During this period, retailers worked to develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants who contributed to modern retail marketing and management methods include: A. T. Stewart, Potter Palmer, John Wanamaker, Montgomery Ward, Marshall Field, Richard Warren Sears, Rowland Macy, J.C. Penney, Fred Lazarus, brothers Edward and William Filene and Sam Walton."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services, led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales. In 1861, Welsh draper Pryce Pryce-Jones sent catalogues to clients who could place orders for flannel clothing which was then despatched by post. This enabled Pryce-Jones to extend his client base across Europe. A decade later, the US retailer, Montgomery Ward also devised a catalogue sales and mail-order system. His first catalogue which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8 in × 12 in (20 cm × 30 cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase ""satisfaction guaranteed or your money back"" which was implemented in 1875. By the 1890s, Sears and Roebuck were also using mail order with great success."
PA,183515-Retail,"Edward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to retail management, developed the concept of the ""automatic bargain Basement"". Although Filene's basement was not the first ‘bargain basement’ in the U.S., the principles of ‘automatic mark-downs’ generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further markdown of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity. Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also played an important role in encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, ""perhaps the earliest American company union"". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes."
PA,183515-Retail,"In the post-war period, an American architect, Victor Gruen developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen's vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954. He went on to design some 50 such malls. Due to the success of the mall concept, Gruen was described as ""the most influential architect of the twentieth century by a journalist in the New Yorker."""
PA,183515-Retail,"Throughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from square feet in 1991 to square feet in 2000. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first hypermarket in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris, France. By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as ""mega-stores"" and ""warehouse"" stores to reflect their growing size. In Australia, for example, the popular hardware chain, Bunnings has shifted from smaller ""home centres"" (retail floor space under ) to ""warehouse"" stores (retail floor space between and ) in order to accommodate a wider range of goods and in response to population growth and changing consumer preferences. The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations, and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe."
PA,183515-Retail,"As the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident. Under such competition and other issues such as business debt, there has been a noted business disruption called the retail apocalypse in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely."
H1,183515-Retail,Retail strategy
PA,183515-Retail,"The distinction between ""strategic"" and ""managerial"" decision-making is commonly used to distinguish ""two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic planning concerns the choice of policies aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial decision-making is focused on the implementation of specific targets."""
PA,183515-Retail,"In retailing, the strategic plan is designed to set out the vision and provide guidance for retail decision-makers and provide an outline of how the product and service mix will optimize customer satisfaction. As part of the strategic planning process, it is customary for strategic planners to carry out a detailed environmental scan which seeks to identify trends and opportunities in the competitive environment, market environment, economic environment and statutory-political environment. The retail strategy is normally devised or reviewed every 3– 5 years by the chief executive officer."
PA,183515-Retail,The strategic retail analysis typically includes following elements:
H1,183515-Retail,* Market analysis
H1,183515-Retail,* Customer analysis
H1,183515-Retail,* Internal analysis
H1,183515-Retail,* Competition analysis
H1,183515-Retail,* Review of product mix
LI,183515-Retail,* Review of distribution channels
LI,183515-Retail,* Evaluation of the economics of the strategy
PA,183515-Retail,"At the conclusion of the retail analysis, the retail marketers should have a clear idea of which groups of customers are to be the target of marketing activities. Retail research studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between a store's positioning and the socio-economic status of customers. In addition, the retail strategy, including service quality, has a significant and positive association with customer loyalty. A marketing strategy effectively outlines all key aspects of firms' targeted audience, demographics, preferences. In a highly competitive market, the retail strategy sets up long-term sustainability. It focuses on customer relationships, stressing the importance of added value, customer satisfaction and highlights how the store's market positioning appeals to targeted groups of customers."
H1,183515-Retail,The retail marketing mix
PA,183515-Retail,See also product management; promotion mix; marketing mix; price; servicescapes and retail design
PA,183515-Retail,"In the 1980s, the customary sales concept in the retail industry gradually showed many disadvantages.Many transactions cost too much, the enterprise can not retain customers, only pay attention to the process of a single transaction, do not pay attention to the marketing of customer development and maintenance, which leads to each transaction need to spend marketing costs to develop new customers, but can not retain customers.The traditional marketing theory holds that the marketing process is a one-time value exchange process with the transaction as the means and exchange of goods needed by both parties as the ultimate purpose.This view holds that when the transaction is completed, the relationship between the two parties will also end, so it is called ""transactive-oriented marketing concept"", which realizes the transaction of products or services between the two parties through the identification of target clients.This transaction-oriented marketing concept generally follows the development process of finding target consumers, negotiating, trading and ending relationships to complete the transaction.This traditional transaction process is a one-time transaction in which both parties aim to maximize their own interests.This kind of transactional marketing concept will bring about follow-up problems such as poor after-sales service quality and lack of feedback channels for both parties.In addition, because it needs to redevelop client relationship for each transaction, it causes a high total transaction cost, which promotes the gradual development of the concept of establishing long term cooperative relationship with customers.That is to say, enterprises begin to pay attention to establishing long term good relations with clients, and focus on the core from transaction to relationship."
PA,183515-Retail,"Although for retail enterprises, expand the sales market and attract new customers is very important, but also should pay attention to retail enterprises to establish and maintain long term good relationship with old customer is also very important, relationship marketing in order to improve the relationship with the customers as the core, which is beneficial to enterprises in the current competitive retail market for the competitiveness of the steady, also is retail enterprise development direction in the future."
PA,183515-Retail,"Once the strategic plan is in place, retail managers turn to the more managerial aspects of planning. A retail mix is devised for the purpose of coordinating day-to-day tactical decisions. The retail marketing mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence). The retail mix is loosely based on the marketing mix, but has been expanded and modified in line with the unique needs of the retail context. A number of scholars have argued for an expanded marketing, mix with the inclusion of two new Ps, namely, ""Personnel"" and ""Presentation"" since these contribute to the customer's unique retail experience and are the principal basis for retail differentiation. Yet other scholars argue that the ""Retail Format"" (i.e. retail formula) should be included. The modified retail marketing mix that is most commonly cited in text-books is often called the ""6 Ps of retailing"" (see diagram at right)."
H1,183515-Retail,Product
H1,183515-Retail,See Product management
PA,183515-Retail,"The primary product-related decisions facing the retailer are the product assortment (what product lines, how many lines and which brands to carry); the type of customer service (high contact through to self-service) and the availability of support services (e.g. credit terms, delivery services, after sales care). These decisions depend on careful analysis of the market, demand, competition as well as the retailer's skills and expertise."
H1,183515-Retail,Product assortment
PA,183515-Retail,The term product assortment refers to the combination of both product breadth and depth. The main characteristics of a company's product assortment are:
PA,183515-Retail,(1) the length or number of products lines
H1,183515-Retail,(2) the breadth
PA,183515-Retail,(3) depth or number of product varieties within a product line
H1,183515-Retail,(4) consistency
PA,183515-Retail,"For a retailer, finding the right balance between breadth and depth can be a key to success. An average supermarket might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth). Speciality retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while Aldi carries just 1,400 lines per store."
PA,183515-Retail,"Large assortments offer consumers many benefits, notably increased choice and the possibility that the consumer will be able to locate the ideal product. However, for the retailer, larger assortments incur costs in terms of record-keeping, managing inventory, pricing and risks associated with wastage due to spoiled, shopworn or unsold stock. Carrying more stock also exposes the retailer to higher risks in terms of slow-moving stock and lower sales per square foot of store space. On the other hand, reducing the number of product lines can generate cost savings through increased stock turnover by eliminating slow-moving lines, fewer stockouts, increased bargaining power with suppliers, reduced costs associated with wastage and carrying inventory, and higher sales per square foot which means more efficient space utilisation."
PA,183515-Retail,"When determining the number of product lines to carry, the retailer must consider the store type, store's physical storage capacity, the perishability of items, expected turnover rates for each line and the customer's needs and expectations."
H1,183515-Retail,Customer service and supporting services
PA,183515-Retail,"Customer service is the ""sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to receive what they need or desire from [the] retail establishment."" Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service in the case of vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and speciality stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about sales support such as customer delivery and after sales customer care."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retailing services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, exchange/ return services, product demonstration, special orders, customer loyalty programs, limited-scale trial, advisory services and a range of other supporting services. Retail stores often seek to differentiate along customer service lines. For example, some department stores offer the services of a ""stylist""; a fashion advisor, to assist customers selecting a fashionable wardrobe for the forthcoming season, while smaller boutiques may allow regular customers to take goods home ""on approval"", enabling the customer to try out goods before making the final purchase. The variety of supporting services offered is known as the ""service type."" At one end of the spectrum, self-service operators offer few basic support services. At the other end of the spectrum, full-service operators offer a broad range of highly personalised customer services to augment the retail experience."
PA,183515-Retail,"When making decisions about customer service, the retailer must balance the customer's desire for full-service against the customer's willingness to pay for the cost of delivering supporting services. Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to pay a premium for the benefits of full-service."
PA,183515-Retail,"A sales assistant's role typically includes greeting customers, providing product and service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service necessary to ensure customer satisfaction. For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and credit transactions, handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships with the potential to turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing reputation and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons. Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. Customer service training entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as Customer relationship management."
H1,183515-Retail,Types of customer service
PA,183515-Retail,There are several ways the retailer can deliver services to consumers:
PA,183515-Retail,"Counter service, where goods are out of reach of buyers and must be obtained from the seller. This type of retail is common for small expensive items (e.g. jewellery) and controlled items like medicine and liquor."
PA,183515-Retail,"Click and Commute, where products are ordered online and are picked up via a drive through."
PA,183515-Retail,"Ship to Store, where products are ordered online and can be picked up at the retailer's main store"
PA,183515-Retail,"Delivery, where goods are shipped directly to consumer's homes or workplaces."
PA,183515-Retail,"Mail order from a printed catalogue was invented in 1744 and was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ordering by telephone was common in the 20th century, either from a catalog, newspaper, television advertisement or a local restaurant menu, for immediate service (especially for pizza delivery), remaining in common use for food orders. Internet shopping  – a form of delivery – has eclipsed phone-ordering, and, in several sectors – such as books and music – all other forms of buying. There is increasing competitor pressure to deliver consumer goods – especially those offered online – in a more timely fashion. Large online retailers such as Amazon.com are continually innovating and as of 2015 offer one-hour delivery in certain areas. They are also working with drone technology to provide consumers with more efficient delivery options. Direct marketing, including telemarketing and television shopping channels, are also used to generate telephone orders. started gaining significant market share in developed countries in the 2000s."
PA,183515-Retail,"Door-to-door sales, where the salesperson sometimes travels with the goods for sale."
PA,183515-Retail,"Self-service, where goods may be handled and examined prior to purchase."
PA,183515-Retail,"Digital delivery or Download, where intangible goods, such as music, film, and electronic books and subscriptions to magazines, are delivered directly to the consumer in the form of information transmitted either over wires or air-waves, and is reconstituted by a device which the consumer controls (such as an MP3 player; see ""digital rights management""). The digital sale of models for 3D printing also fits here, as do the media leasing types of services, such as streaming."

H1,183515-Retail,Also see Site selection
PA,183515-Retail,"Perspective of large retail enterprises of supply chain relationship marketing is based on the theory of supply chain management in large retail enterprises of supply chain in the application of relationship marketing, it emphasizes that the suppliers, large-scale retail enterprises, customers form a chain of large retail enterprises and suppliers to form cooperative marketing, establish mutually beneficial long term good relationship with customers.Relationship marketing of huge retail enterprises from the perspective of supply chain mainly includes two relationship markets, supplier relationship and customer relationship market.Because the two stakeholders that have the greatest influence on the profits of retail enterprises are suppliers and customers.First, as the supplier of commodities to retail enterprises, it directly determines the procurement cost of commodities to retail enterprises, which is mainly reflected in the purchase price of commodities themselves, the cost incurred in the procurement process, and the loss cost caused by unstable supply of commodities.In addition, the good relationship with supplier interaction, large retail enterprises can also promote the suppliers timely grasp the market information, improved or innovative products according to customer demand, which contributed to the retail enterprises improve the market competitiveness of the goods are sold, so the retail enterprise's relationship with supplier directly affects the retail enterprises in the commodity market competitive.Second, due to the transfer of advantages between buyers and sellers, the retail industry has turned to the buyer's market, and consumers have become the key resources for major retailers to compete with each other. Therefore, it is very important to establish a good relationship with clients and improve customer loyalty. The relationship marketing of customer relationship market regards the transaction with clients as a long term activity.Retail enterprises should pursue long-term mutual benefit maximization rather than a single transaction sales profit maximization.This requires large retail enterprises to establish a customer-oriented trading relationship with the customer relationship market."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail stores are typically located where market opportunities are optimal – high traffic areas, central business districts. Selecting the right site can be a major success factor. When evaluating potential sites, retailers often carry out a ""trade area analysis""; a detailed analysis designed to approximate the potential patronage area. Techniques used in trade area analysis include: Radial (ring) studies; Gravity models and Drive time analyses."

H1,183515-Retail,Channels
PA,183515-Retail,"A major retail trend has been the shift to multi-channel retailing. To counter the disruption caused by online retail, many bricks and mortar retailers have entered the online retail space, by setting up online catalogue sales and e-commerce websites. However, many retailers have noticed that consumers behave differently when shopping online. For instance, in terms of choice of online platform, shoppers tend to choose the online site of their preferred retailer initially, but as they gain more experience in online shopping, they become less loyal and more likely to switch to other retail sites. Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers in Western countries have Internet access both at work and at home."

H1,183515-Retail,See also Pricing Strategies
PA,183515-Retail,"The broad pricing strategy is normally established in the company's overall strategic plan. In the case of chain stores, the pricing strategy would be set by head office. Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:"
H1,183515-Retail,Pricing tactics
PA,183515-Retail,"When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall strategic approach."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retailers must also plan for customer preferred payment modes – e.g. cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require some type of handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms will need to be determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need to take into account the storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin. For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments."
PA,183515-Retail,"Contrary to common misconception, price is not the most important factor for consumers, when deciding to buy a product."
PA,183515-Retail,Pricing tactics that are commonly used in retail include:
H1,183515-Retail,Discount pricing
PA,183515-Retail,"Discount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced price. Discounts in a variety of forms – e.g. quantity discounts, loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts etc."
LI,183515-Retail,Everyday low prices (EDLP)
PA,183515-Retail,Everyday low prices refers to the practice of maintaining a regular low price-low price – in which consumers are not forced to wait for discounting or specials. This method is extensively used by supermarkets.
H1,183515-Retail,High-low pricing
PA,183515-Retail,"High-low pricing refers to the practice of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle."
H1,183515-Retail,Loss leader
PA,183515-Retail,"A loss leader is a product that has a price set below the operating margin. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and budget-priced retail outlets where it is intended to generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders."
H1,183515-Retail,Price bundling
PA,183515-Retail,"Price bundling (also known as product bundling) occurs where two or more products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: ""pure bundles"" where the goods can only be purchased as package or ""mixed bundles"" where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately. Price bundling is extensively used in the personal care sector to prices cosmetics and skincare."
H1,183515-Retail,Price lining
PA,183515-Retail,"""Price lining"" is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a tradition started in the old five and dime stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40."
H1,183515-Retail,Promotional pricing
PA,183515-Retail,"Promotional pricing is a temporary measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for a good or service. Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits."
H1,183515-Retail,Psychological pricing
PA,183515-Retail,"Psychological pricing is a range of tactics designed to have a positive psychological impact. Price tags using the terminal digit ""9"", ($9.99, $19.99 or $199.99) can be used to signal price points and bring an item in at just under the consumer's reservation price. Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings."
H1,183515-Retail,Personnel and staffing
PA,183515-Retail,"Because patronage at a retail outlet varies, flexibility in scheduling is desirable. Employee scheduling software is sold, which, using known patterns of customer patronage, more or less reliably predicts the need for staffing for various functions at times of the year, day of the month or week, and time of day. Usually needs vary widely. Conforming staff utilization to staffing needs requires a flexible workforce which is available when needed but does not have to be paid when they are not, part-time workers; as of 2012 70% of retail workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial problems for the workers, who while they are required to be available at all times if their work hours are to be maximized, may not have sufficient income to meet their family and other obligations."

Retail promotions that focus on the store tend to be ‘image’ oriented, raising awareness of the store and creating a positive attitude towards the store and its services. Retail promotions that focus on the product range, are designed to cultivate a positive attitude to the brands stocked by the store, in order to indirectly encourage favourable attitudes towards the store itself. Some retail advertising and promotion is partially or wholly funded by brands and this is known as co-operative (or co-op) advertising."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retailers make extensive use of advertising via newspapers, television and radio to encourage store preference. In order to up-sell or cross-sell, retailers also use a variety of in-store sales promotional techniques such as product demonstrations, samples, point-of-purchase displays, free trial, events, promotional packaging and promotional pricing. In grocery retail, shelf wobblers, trolley advertisements, taste tests and recipe cards are also used. Many retailers also use loyalty programs to encourage repeat patronage."

LI,183515-Retail,See Merchandising; Servicescapes; Retail design
PA,183515-Retail,"Presentation refers to the physical evidence that signals the retail image. Physical evidence may include a diverse range of elements – the store itself including premises, offices, exterior facade and interior layout, websites, delivery vans, warehouses, staff uniforms."
H1,183515-Retail,Designing retail spaces
PA,183515-Retail,"The environment in which the retail service encounter occurs is sometimes known as the ""retail servicescape."" The store environment consists of many elements such as smells, the physical environment (furnishings, layout and functionality), ambient conditions (lighting, temperature, noise) as well as signs, symbols and artifacts (e.g. sales promotions, shelf space, sample stations, visual communications). Collectively, these elements contribute to the ""perceived retail servicescape"" or the overall ""atmosphere"" and can influence both the customer's cognitions, emotions and their behaviour within the retail space."
H1,183515-Retail,Relationship between market
PA,183515-Retail,"Large retail enterprises of relationship marketing refers to a large retail enterprise with suppliers, customers, internal organization, channel distributors, market impact, and other competitors such as the interests of the enterprise marketing process related everything to establish and maintain good relations, thus maximizing the interests of the large retail enterprise in the long-term marketing activities, it was based on the relationship marketing concept as the core of innovation.Different from traditional marketing concepts, relationship marketing focuses on maintaining long-term good relations with relevant parties on marketing activities. The ultimate goal of relationship marketing is tantamount to maximize the long term interests of enterprises."
PA,183515-Retail,"The marketing activities of large retail enterprises mainly have six relationship markets, which are supplier relationship market, customer relationship market, enterprise internal relationship market, intermediary relationship market at all levels, enterprise marketing activities influence relationship market and industry competitor relationship market.Among these six relational markets, supply relational market and customer relational market are the two markets that have the greatest influence on the relationship marketing of large retail enterprises.Substantial retail enterprises usually have two sources of profit. The principal source of profit is to reduce the purchase price from suppliers. The other is to develop new customers and keep old clients, so as to expand the market sales of goods.In addition, the extra four related markets have an indirect impact on the marketing activities of large retail enterprises."
PA,183515-Retail,"The internal relationship market of an enterprise can be divided into several different types of relationships according to distinct objects, such as employee relationship market, department relationship market, shareholder relationship market and the mutual relations among the relationship markets. The purpose of carrying out relationship marketing is to promote the cohesion and innovation ability of enterprises and maximize the long term interests of enterprises. Another relationship of relationship marketing middlemen is the relationship between market and intermediary in the process of corporate marketing is playing the intermediary role between suppliers and customers, in the current increasingly fierce market competition, more important distribution channels for enterprises, but for retail enterprises, too much sales levels will increase the cost of sales of the enterprise. Therefore, large retail enterprises should realize the simplification of sales channel level by reasonably selecting suppliers.Large-scale retail enterprises purchasing goods to suppliers with procurement scale advantage, can directly contact with the product manufacturing, with strong bargaining power, therefore, direct contact with the manufacturer is a large retail enterprise to take the main purchasing mode, it is a terminal to the starting point of zero level channel purchasing mode, therefore, the elimination of middlemen, so as to make the large retail enterprise in the marketing activity, the dealer relationship market is not so important.Then there is the enterprise influence relationship market, which is a relational marketing influence in the enterprise supply chain. It mainly guides and standardizes the advance direction of enterprises through formulating systems at the macro level.The relationship market mainly includes the relationship between the relevant government departments at all levels where the enterprise is located, the relationship with the industry association to which the enterprise belongs, and the relationship with all kinds of public organizations, etc., and the enterprise influence itself cannot directly affect the marketing activities of the enterprise.The final relational market is the industry's competitors, potential competitors, alternative competitors and so on.How to correctly deal with the relationship between competitors and the market has become a problem that large retail enterprises need to solve."
PA,183515-Retail,"Retail designers pay close attention to the front of the store, which is known as the ""decompression zone"".This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, the side of the road cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left."
PA,183515-Retail,"In order to maximise the number of selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers to spend more time in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times. The overall aim of designing a retail environment is to have customers enter the store, and explore the totality of the physical environment engaging in a variety of retail experiences – from browsing through to sampling and ultimately to purchasing. The retail service environment plays an important role in affecting the customer's perceptions of the retail experience."
PA,183515-Retail,"The retail environment not only affects quality perceptions, but can also impact on the way that customers navigate their way through the retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, is an example of a retail design feature known as a ""merchandise outpost"" and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty."
PA,183515-Retail,"According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects how easy or difficult it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise the amount of time spent finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation – design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination – design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience – design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees."
PA,183515-Retail,"The way that brands are displayed is also part of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access. Products placed too high or too low on the shelves may not turn over as quickly as those placed at eye level. With respect to access, store designers are increasingly giving consideration to access for disabled and elderly customers."
PA,183515-Retail,"Through sensory stimulation retailers can engage maximum emotional impact between a brand and its consumers by relating to both profiles; the goal and experience. Purchasing behaviour can be influenced through the physical evidence detected by the senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and sound. Supermarkets offer taste testers to heighten the sensory experience of brands. Coffee shops allow the aroma of coffee to waft into streets so that passers-by can appreciate the smell and perhaps be lured inside. Clothing garments are placed at arms' reach, allowing customers to feel the different textures of clothing. Retailers understand that when customers interact with products or handle the merchandise, they are more likely to make a purchase."
PA,183515-Retail,"Within the retail environment, different spaces may be designed for different purposes. Hard floors, such as wooden floors, used in public areas, contrast with carpeted fitting rooms, which are designed to create a sense of homeliness when trying on garments. Peter Alexander, retailer of sleep ware, is renowned for using scented candles in retail stores."
PA,183515-Retail,"Ambient conditions, such as lighting, temperature and music, are also part of the overall retail environment. It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target market. Studies have found that ""positively valenced music will stimulate more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced music"", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music. In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow. Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction. Jewellery stores like Michael Hill have dim lighting with a view to fostering a sense of intimacy."
PA,183515-Retail,"The design of a retail store is critical when appealing to the intended market, as this is where first impressions are made. The overall servicescape can influence a consumer's perception of the quality of the store, communicating value in visual and symbolic ways. Certain techniques are used to create a consumer brand experience, which in the long run drives store loyalty."
H1,183515-Retail,Shopper profiles
PA,183515-Retail,"Two different strands of research have investigated shopper behaviour. One strand is primarily concerned with shopper motivations. Another stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into shopper behaviour."
PA,183515-Retail,"Babin et al. carried out some of the earliest investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: ""utilitarian"" and ""hedonic."" Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience."
PA,183515-Retail,"Many different shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation analyses for each unique outlet. However, it is possible to identify a number of broad shopper profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited shopper typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s. Sproles and Kendall's consumer typology has been shown to be relatively consistent across time and across cultures. Their typology is based on the consumer's approach to making purchase decisions."
PA,183515-Retail,Quality conscious/Perfectionist: Quality-consciousness is characterised by a consumer's search for the very best quality in products; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around.
PA,183515-Retail,"Brand-conscious: Brand-consciousness is characterised by a tendency to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets."
PA,183515-Retail,Recreation-conscious/ Hedonistic: Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.
PA,183515-Retail,"Price-conscious: A consumer who exhibits price-and-value consciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices, sales or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money"
PA,183515-Retail,"Novelty/fashion-conscious: characterised by a consumer's tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; they like to keep up-to-date with fashions and trends, variety-seeking is associated with this dimension."
PA,183515-Retail,"Impulsive: Impulsive consumers are somewhat careless in making purchase decisions, buy on the spur of the moment and are not overly concerned with expenditure levels or obtaining value. Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level."
PA,183515-Retail,"Confused (by over-choice): characterised by a consumer's confusion caused by too many product choices, too many stores or an overload of product information; tend to experience information overload."
PA,183515-Retail,Habitual / brand loyal: characterised by a consumer's tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion; consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing; the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around.
PA,183515-Retail,"Some researchers have adapted Sproles and Kendall's methodology for use in specific countries or cultural groups. Consumer decision styles are important for retailers and marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and for this reason, they are useful for market segmentation."
LI,183515-Retail,Retail format: types of retail outlet
PA,183515-Retail,"The ""retail format"" (also known as the ""retail formula"") influences the consumer's store choice and addresses the consumer's expectations. At its most basic level, a retail format is a simple marketplace, that is; a location where goods and services are exchanged. In some parts of the world, the retail sector is still dominated by small family-run stores, but large retail chains are increasingly dominating the sector, because they can exert considerable buying power and pass on the savings in the form of lower prices. Many of these large retail chains also produce their own private labels which compete alongside manufacturer brands. Considerable consolidation of retail stores has changed the retail landscape, transferring power away from wholesalers and into the hands of the large retail chains."

PA,183515-Retail,"Grocery stores, including supermarkets and hypermarkets, along with convenience stores carry a mix of food products and consumable household items such as detergents, cleansers, personal hygiene products. Consumer consumables are collectively known as fast-moving-consumer goods (FMCG) and represent the lines most often carried by supermarkets, grocers and convenience stores. For consumers, these are regular purchases and for the retailer, these products represent high turnover product lines. Grocery stores and convenience stores carry similar lines, but a convenience store is often open at times that suit its clientele and may be located for ease of access."
H1,183515-Retail,Hardline retailers
PA,183515-Retail,"Retailers selling consumer durables are sometimes known as ""hardline retailers"" – automobiles, appliances, electronics, furniture, sporting goods, lumber, etc., and parts for them. Goods that do not quickly wear out and provide utility over time. For the consumer, these items often represent major purchase decisions. Consumers purchase durables over longer purchase decision cycles. For instance, the typical consumer might replace their family car every 5 years, and their home computer every 4 years."

PA,183515-Retail,Types of retail outlet by marketing strategy include:
H2,183515-Retail,Arcade
PA,183515-Retail,"A shopping arcade refers to a group of retail outlets operating under a covered walkway. Arcades are similar to shopping malls, although they typically comprise a smaller number of outlets. Shopping arcades were the evolutionary precursor to the shopping mall, and were very fashionable in the late 19th-century. Stylish men and women would promenade around the arcade, stopping to window shop, making purchases and also taking light refreshments in one of the arcade's tea-rooms. Arcades offered fashionable men and women opportunities to 'be seen' and to socialise in a relatively safe environment. Arcades continue to exist as a distinct type of retail outlet. Historic 19th-century arcades have become popular tourist attractions in cities around the world. Amusement arcades, also known as penny arcades in the US, are more modern incarnation of the eighteenth and nineteenth century shopping arcade."

LI,183515-Retail,Category killer
PA,183515-Retail,"By supplying a wide assortment in a single category for lower prices a category killer retailer can ""kill"" that category for other retailers. A category killer is a specialist store that dominates a given category. Toys ""R"" Us, established in 1957, is thought to be the first category killer, dominating the children's toys and games market. For a few categories, such as electronics, home hardware, office supplies and children's toys, the products are displayed at the centre of the store and a sales person will be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when required. Rival retail stores are forced to reduce their prices if a category killer enters the market in a given geographic area. Examples of category killers include Toys ""R"" Us and Australia's Bunnings (hardware, DIY and outdoor supplies) and Officeworks (stationery and supplies for the home office and small office). Some category killers redefine the category. For example, Australia's Bunnings began as a hardware outlet, but now supplies a broad range of goods for the home handyman or small tradesman, including kitchen cabinetry, craft supplies, gardening needs and outdoor furniture. Similarly Officeworks straddles the boundary between stationery supplies, office furniture and digital communications devices in its quest to provide for all the needs of the retail consumer and the small, home office."
LI,183515-Retail,Chain store
PA,183515-Retail,"Chain store is one of a series of stores owned by the same company and selling the same or similar merchandise.

LI,183515-Retail,Concept store
PA,183515-Retail,"Concept stores are similar to speciality stores in that they are very small in size, and only stock a limited range of brands or a single brand. They are typically operated by the brand that controls them. Example: L'OCCITANE en Provence. The limited size and offering of L'OCCITANE's stores is too small to be considered a speciality store. However, a concept store goes beyond merely selling products, and instead offers an immersive customer experience built around the way that a brand fits with the customer's lifestyle. Examples include Apple's concept stores, Kit Kat's concept store in Japan."

It was built on the east bank of the Mississippi River in today's Nicollet Island/East Bank neighborhood; it is the oldest continuously used church building in the city and is part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District."

PA,10384135-Our-Lady-of-Lourdes-Catholic-Church--Minneapolis--Minnesota,"The oldest church building in Minneapolis, Our Lady of Lourdes has been in continuous use since the mid-19th century. The First Universalist Society of St. Anthony erected the building in Greek Revival style as a meeting hall between 1854 and 1857 as the First Universalist Church where they worshipped until 1877. A congregation of Catholic French Canadians acquired the church in 1877 and named it in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary who Catholics believed had recently appeared to Bernadette Soubirous in France as Our Lady of Lourdes. One of many churches throughout the world named for the appearances in Lourdes, Our Lady of Lourdes in Minneapolis was the first in the U.S. with this name. The Catholic parish made significant additions to the building between 1880–83, adding a transept, apse and front bell tower with three steeples; a front vestibule was added in 1914."
PA,10384135-Our-Lady-of-Lourdes-Catholic-Church--Minneapolis--Minnesota,"Near the birthplace of Minneapolis, the church stands near the Pillsbury ""A"" Mill and the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. The building is not listed as a National Historic Landmark but it is the subject of Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) drawings and photographs created in 1934."
PA,10384135-Our-Lady-of-Lourdes-Catholic-Church--Minneapolis--Minnesota,The parish school spoke French until about 1917 when the congregation dwindled and by 1945 the priests gave sermons only in English. The church survived extinction when the Minneapolis City Council persuaded bishops of the diocese to stop plans to close and board it up in 1968. Our Lady of Lourdes is now one of 85 contributing properties of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Universalists constructed the original building of limestone quarried at nearby Nicollet Island in Greek Revival style based on a Greek temple (shown below at left). Their design was and built at a cost of $15,000. In the 1880s, the Catholic congregation added a V-frame beam truss, the steeple, the transept, bell tower, sacristy and vestibule in French Provincial and Gothic Revival style.

H2,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,Briefing
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The Punch-up in Piestany was a bench-clearing brawl between Canada and the Soviet Union, during the final game of the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Piešťany, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), on January 4, 1987. The incident resulted in the ejection of both nations, and while the Soviets had already been eliminated from medal contention, the disqualification cost Canada a medal – potentially the gold. The brawl is famous for officials having turned off the arena lights in a desperate attempt at ending the 20-minute melee. Much of the blame was placed on Norwegian referee Hans Rønning, who had been selected for the game based on his perceived neutrality rather than experience."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Following the brawl, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) suspended the players involved for 18 months and the coaches for three years. The players' suspensions were later reduced to six months on appeal, allowing several players from both teams to return for the 1988 tournament in Moscow. Both nations won medals in 1988; Canada won the gold medal while the Soviets won silver."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The brawl dramatically raised the profile of the World Junior Hockey Championships in Canada, where it is now one of the top events on the annual sports calendar. The fervent patriotism displayed by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation analyst Don Cherry in the aftermath led to a sharp rise in his own popularity with Canadian fans. Several players in that game went on to play in the National Hockey League, including Brendan Shanahan, Theoren Fleury, Mike Keane, Sergei Fedorov, Alexander Mogilny and Vladimir Konstantinov."
H1,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Hockey's ""Cold War"""
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Canada and the Soviet Union had engaged in an increasingly intense rivalry since the Soviets first emerged on the international scene by winning the 1954 World Ice Hockey Championships. From 1963 until 1983, the Soviets captured 17 World Championship titles amidst repeated accusations from Canada that their teams were made up of professionals masquerading as amateurs. The accusations eventually led to Canada boycotting all World Championships and Olympic hockey tournaments between 1970 and 1976. Finally, the 1972 Summit Series was organized, pitting the Soviet all-stars against Canada's NHL all-stars. The eight-game series was won by Canada 4–3–1 as Paul Henderson scored the winning goal late in the deciding contest. The Soviets handily won a second Summit Series against the World Hockey Association all-stars in 1974. The series led to the creation of the Canada Cup, a tournament held five times between 1976 and 1991. Canada won four titles, losing to the Soviet Union in 1981. Also from 1976 until 1991, top Soviet club teams toured the NHL in what became known as the Super Series."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The World Junior Championships were formally created in 1977, and to that point had been dominated by the Soviet Union with seven championships. Until 1982, Canada sent either their Memorial Cup champion or an all-star team. 1982 was the first time Canada sent a national junior team, under the auspices of Hockey Canada's ""Program of Excellence"". The Canadians won that tournament, and again in 1985."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The ""Cold War"" culminated in 1987 with Rendez-vous '87, as the Soviet national team played a two-game series against the NHL all-stars in place of the NHL All-Star Game. The series was split, with the NHL winning the first game 4–3, and the Soviets the second, 5–3. The 1987 Canada Cup followed, and was won by Canada two games to one, with the third game being described as the greatest in hockey history. The winning goal was scored by Mario Lemieux on a pass from Wayne Gretzky."
H1,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,Game summary
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"In 1987, the World Junior Hockey Championship was a round robin tournament. The teams with the top three records won the gold, silver and bronze medals. Finland had finished their schedule with a 5–1–1 record to lead the tournament. Canada entered the game with a 4–1–1 record, and had already been assured the bronze medal. A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by 5 goals or more would have won the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering the game with a 2–3–1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled to be the final game of the tournament as organizers expected at least one of the teams would be playing for the gold medal."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The IIHF assigned Norway's Hans Rønning as the referee for this game. The assignment was made based on his neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials were not on the ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Off the opening faceoff, Sergei Shesterikov elbowed Canadian Dave McLlwain, who responded by cross-checking the Soviet player. Neither player was assessed a penalty. Five minutes in, Theoren Fleury scored the opening goal for Canada. In celebrating the goal, Fleury slid across centre ice on his knees acting as if his stick was a machine gun and pretended to ""open fire"" on the Soviet bench. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president Murray Costello later called it an ""inflammatory act, completely unnecessary, lacking any sort of respect."" The first period continued in similar fashion with both teams repeatedly slashing their opponents and Canada emerging with a 3–1 lead. Interviewed by the CBC during the intermission, Fleury described the atmosphere on the ice: ""The boys are up for the gold medal. Everybody is so tense. Tempers are flying. It's really tough out there... I can't believe it. It's so tense. It's so tense."""
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Early in the second period, the game was paused for a moment of silence in memory of four Swift Current Broncos players who were killed when their team bus crashed in Saskatchewan five days previous. There was a drop in intensity in the five minutes of play that followed. However, just after the six-minute mark, following a minor scuffle that sent two players from each team to the penalty box, the teams resumed shoving and slashing at each other. Each team also scored a goal, giving Canada a 4–2 lead halfway through the game."
H2,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,The brawl
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The brawl began after a face-off as Shesterikov collided with Everett Sanipass with 6:07 left in the second period, resulting in a fight between the two. Soviet player Pavel Kostichkin also leveled a two-handed slash at Fleury, leading to another fight. The battle quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice for both teams. Returning from a commercial break, Canadian commentator Don Wittman understated the severity of the fighting by saying ""well, we had a real skirmish just moments ago following a face-off."" Evgeny Davydov was the first player from either team to leave his bench to join the melee, prompting all players from both teams to leave their benches."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Mike Keane paired off against Valeri Zelepukin, with the Canadian ""fighting like it was for the world title"" according to Fleury. In another fight, Vladimir Konstantinov leveled a head-butt that broke Greg Hawgood's nose; Brendan Shanahan later described it as ""the greatest head-butt I've ever seen"". Stéphane Roy was pummeled by two Soviet players. The remaining players paired off as the officials attempted to break up the fighting. There were at least a dozen separate fights over the entire ice surface. Unable to control the situation, Rønning and his linesmen eventually left the ice under the orders of Czechoslovakian officials. In a desperate attempt at ending the brawl, tournament officials had the arena lights turned off, leaving the players to fight in the dark as the fans whistled loudly in disapproval of the entire situation. The whole stadium shouted ""My chceme hokej, my chceme hokej"", which translates to ""We want hockey, we want hockey"". By the time the fights had finally broken up, the IIHF declared the game null and void."
H1,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,Aftermath
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The IIHF held an emergency meeting in an arena office to decide how to handle the incident. Each team was represented by a delegate, and the meeting was chaired by IIHF President Günther Sabetzki. The delegates voted 7–1 in favour of ejecting both teams from the tournament, the lone dissenting vote being that of Canada's Dennis McDonald. McDonald was incensed by the voting: Finland, Czechoslovakia and Sweden all stood to gain medal position by voting the two teams out, the Americans only promised support if other nations supported Canada, and Sabetzki could barely control his disdain for the Canadians."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"After voting to eject the two teams, IIHF officials banned the Soviets from the tournament banquet and medal ceremony, but still invited Canada. McDonald stated the Canadians were not interested, but Sabetzki and Czechoslovak officials ordered the Canadian team out of the arena within half an hour. They were met by armed soldiers who escorted them across the border and out of Czechoslovakia. The IIHF voided the individual standings of both teams. In the words of McDonald, ""it was like we were never here."" However, the other teams kept the points they gained in the matches against both teams."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Both teams attempted to blame the other for allowing the violence to get out of hand. Soviet official Anatoly Kastriukov blamed a Canadian trainer for igniting hostilities by running over to the Soviet bench and punching one of their assistant coaches in the stomach. The Canadians, meanwhile, pointed to Davydov being the first off the bench as being the spark that led to the brawl. CBC commentator Don Cherry was one of the first to float a conspiracy theory that the Soviets had done so as a deliberate attempt to have Canada ejected, and therefore lose a medal. Alan Eagleson suggested that the IIHF's decision would have been different had it been the Soviets in contention for a medal, and not the Canadians."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. The player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players to participate in the 1988 tournament, and Alexander Mogilny to play in the 1988 Winter Olympics. The IIHF also considered either demoting both teams to the B pool or banning them from the 1988 tournament as further punishment, but backed off as the next year's tournament was set to be held in the Soviet Union, while Canada represented the only media revenue the tournament generated at the time."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Among the Canadians, only two players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. Waite felt he could not risk being ejected for fighting under the belief that the game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: ""I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed."""
H1,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,Legacy
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"At the 1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Moscow, Canada and the Soviet Union won the gold and silver medals, respectively, as both teams' rosters featured several players from the 1987 tournament. Since the 1987 tournament, the two nations have maintained their dominance of the tournament. Canada has won 14 gold medals between 1988 and 2015, while the Soviet Union, and its successor, Russia, has won six."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Hans Rønning's assignment to officiate the game was viewed by other on-ice officials as a nod to organizers from Lillehammer, Norway, who had just won the right to host the 1994 Winter Olympics and were observing the game. At age 38, Rønning expected the 1987 tournament to be among his last international assignments. Rønning never officiated another international game, though he did referee two more seasons in Norway before retiring."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"In Canada, public sentiment widely supported the players. Opinion polls taken in the aftermath of the brawl saw 87–92% of respondents supporting their actions. Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that ""I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm going to see to it that they get them. Imagine how these Russians [""sic""] engineered this whole thing over there just because they've got a lousy team and were scared to go home finishing in sixth place."""
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Canadian hockey officials criticized the players for the brawl. In 2005, the suggestion of a reunion for the 1987 team was met with uncomfortable silence and ""I don't think so"" from Hockey Canada officials. Immediately following the tournament, Canadian officials were seen as trying to distance themselves from the team: ""The CAHA (Canadian Amateur Hockey Association) didn't do anything for these kids"", reporter Jim Cressman said. ""These kids were good enough to make this team. They gave up their holidays, did their best, risked getting hurt and ended up on the wrong end of a bad decision - and the CAHA basically handed them their tickets."" Winnipeg Jets assistant general manager Mike Smith was in the Vienna airport while the Canadian juniors were waiting for their flight, and took the opportunity to criticize them for their play at the tournament as well as the brawl."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Before Piešťany, the junior tournament had a small following in Canada. Only one Canadian reporter flew overseas to cover the 1987 tournament. That changed in 1988, as the major Canadian media outlets all sent reporters to Moscow. The tournament's prestige in Canada continued to grow. By the 2005 tournament, over 100 Canadian reporters covered the tournament in Grand Forks, North Dakota."
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"The brawl was seen as an embarrassment by Soviet officials who prided themselves on the discipline of their teams. A senior official, Anatoly Kostryukov, said that the ""ice hockey department and the Ice Hockey Federation of the USSR will soon analyze the Soviet team's performance at the championship, and those guilty of the incident will be strictly punished"". The Soviet media agency, Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, was highly critical of the coaching staff's inability to control the players. Head coach Vladimir Vasiliev was fired as the coach of the Soviet national junior team as a result of Piešťany."
H1,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,Players
PA,15093819-Punch-up-in-Piestany,"Of the 20 players who dressed for Canada in that game, 19 went on to play in the National Hockey League. (Shawn Simpson was drafted by the Capitals, and dressed for two games for them, but ultimately only played for their associate team.) In 1987, only one Soviet had ever played in the NHL, Victor Nechayev. The players for this Soviet team would be among the first wave of Eastern Bloc players to arrive in the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain. Five of them would ultimately win the Stanley Cup."

H2,1204012-Bhangmeter,Bhangmeter
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"A bhangmeter is a non-imaging radiometer installed on reconnaissance and navigation satellites to detect atmospheric nuclear detonations and determine the yield of the nuclear weapon. They are also installed on some armored fighting vehicles, in particular NBC reconnaissance vehicles, in order to help detect, localise and analyse tactical nuclear detonations. They are often used alongside pressure and sound sensors in this role in addition to standard radiation sensors. Some nuclear bunkers and military facilities may also be equipped with such sensors alongside seismic event detectors."
H1,1204012-Bhangmeter,History
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"The bhangmeter was invented, and the first proof-of-concept device was built, in 1948 to measure the nuclear test detonations of Operation Sandstone. Prototype and production instruments were later built by EG&G, and the name ""bhangmeter"" was coined in 1950. Bhangmeters became standard instruments used to observe US nuclear tests. A bhangmeter was developed to observe the detonations of Operation Buster-Jangle (1951) and Operation Tumbler-Snapper (1952). These tests lay the groundwork for a large deployment of nationwide North American bhangmeters with the Bomb Alarm System (1961-1967)."
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"US president John F. Kennedy and the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty on August 5, 1963, under the condition that each party could use its own technical means to monitor the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere or in outer space."
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"Bhangmeters were first installed, in 1961, aboard a modified US KC-135A aircraft monitoring the pre-announced Soviet test of Tsar Bomba."
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,The Vela satellites were the first space-based observation devices jointly developed by the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission. The first generation of Vela satellites were not equipped with bhangmeters but with X-ray sensors to detect the intense single pulse of X-rays produced by a nuclear explosion. The first satellites which incorporated bhangmeters were the Advanced Vela satellites.
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"Since 1980, bhangmeters are part of US GPS navigation satellites."
H1,1204012-Bhangmeter,Description
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"The silicon photodiode sensors are designed to detect the distinctive bright double pulse of visible light that is emitted from atmospheric nuclear weapons explosions. This signature consists of a short and intense flash lasting around 1 millisecond, followed by a second much more prolonged and less intense emission of light taking a fraction of a second to several seconds to build up. This signature, with a double intensity maximum, is characteristic of atmospheric nuclear explosions and is the result of the Earth's atmosphere becoming opaque to visible light and transparent again as the explosion's shock wave travels through it."
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"The effect occurs because the surface of the early fireball is quickly overtaken by the expanding ""case shock"", the atmospheric shock wave composed of the ionised plasma of what was once the casing and other matter of the device. Although it emits a considerable amount of light itself, it is opaque and prevents the far brighter fireball from shining through. The net result recorded is a decrease of the light visible from outer space as the shock wave expands, producing the first peak recorded by the bhangmeter."
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"As it expands, the shock wave cools off and becomes less opaque to the visible light produced by the inner fireball. The bhangmeter starts eventually to record an increase in visible light intensity. The expansion of the fireball leads to an increase of its surface area and consequently an increase of the amount of visible light radiated off to space. The fireball continuing to cool down, the amount of light eventually starts to decrease, causing the second peak observed by the bhangmeter. The time between the first and second peaks can be used to determine its nuclear yield."
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"The effect is unambiguous for explosions below about altitude, but above this height a more ambiguous single pulse is produced."
H1,1204012-Bhangmeter,Origin of the name
PA,1204012-Bhangmeter,"The name of the detector is a pun, which was bestowed upon it by Fred Reines, one of the scientists working on the project. The name is derived from the Hindi word ""bhang"", a locally grown variety of cannabis which is smoked or drunk to induce intoxicating effects, the joke being that one would have to be on drugs to believe the bhangmeter detectors would work properly. This is in contrast to a ""bangmeter"" one might associate with detection of nuclear explosions."

PA,1992444-Hap-Holmes,"Harry George ""Hap"" Holmes (February 21, 1888 – June 27, 1941) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. As a professional, Holmes won the Stanley Cup four times, with four teams. He tied the record of his 1914 Stanley Cup winning Toronto Blueshirts teammate Jack Marshall, who also won Cups with four teams. No other player has duplicated this record."
PA,1992444-Hap-Holmes,"Holmes played as an amateur for three season with the Parkdale Canoe Club of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1908 to 1911, before joining the professional Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1912–13. Holmes won the first of his four Stanley Cups in 1914. Although being under contract to the Blueshirts, Holmes joined the Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) for the 1915–16 season, winning his second Stanley Cup (1917) in his second season with the Metropolitans. For the 1917–18 season, Holmes ended up playing for the Torontos (the following year renamed as the Toronto Arenas) of the National Hockey League (NHL) through a series of loans by other teams. Holmes won his third Stanley Cup in his only full season with the Torontos. After playing two games in the 1918-19 season for the Toronto Arenas, Holmes would be recalled by the Metropolitans. Holmes played for the Metropolitans for the next six seasons, until the team folded. In the 1924–25 season, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars of the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL/WHL). Holmes played for the Cougars for two seasons, winning the Stanley Cup for his fourth and last time. After the WCHL/WHL league folded, Holmes joined the Detroit Cougars of the NHL, playing with the Cougars for two seasons before retiring."

His son succeeded him in the businesses and expanded them for his own children as successors."

PA,10202950-Joseph-Edison-Walker,"On July 28, 1958, Walker was shot to death in his office by Judge Washington Hamilton, a former deacon of the non-denominational Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church founded by Dr. Walker. The two men were once close friends, but their relationship began to sour after Hamilton was unable to repay a $8,000 loan. Hamilton attacked Walker with a cane in April 1956, but Dr. Walker refused to file charges against him or hire a bodyguard. Walker's death was widely reported in the media. Journalists estimated that 35,000 came to view his casket as his body lay in state."
PA,10202950-Joseph-Edison-Walker,"Dr. Walker's will, drafted before his second marriage, left the bulk of his estate to his two children. Louise O'Reilly Walker filed a ""widow's dissent"" with the Probate Court because no provision was made for her in the will."

H1,12603921-Iway,Brief
PA,12603921-Iway,"The Iway is the $610 million project by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) to relocate the Interstate 195 and Interstate 95 intersection in Providence, Rhode Island. As of Spring 2013, all reconstruction and demolition is complete, and the last remaining project is to rebuild city streets around the deconstructed corridor."
PA,12603921-Iway,"The project freed up space in downtown Providence and the Jewelry District. It involved renovating India Point Park and constructing a -wide pedestrian bridge; building a signature arch bridge over the Providence River; and improved highway flow, access, and safety, as the existing intersection was not built for modern traffic standards. The previous lane alignment was dangerous and created congestion, as lane shifts were often required to avoid a left sided exit-only lane; moreover, the concrete supports deteriorated to the point that steel shoring are needed to reinforce the intersection's many bridges."
H1,12603921-Iway,History
PA,12603921-Iway,"Back in the 1980s, RIDOT reviewed many plans to deal with the aging section of I-195 in Providence, which was built in the 1950s. Along with having to complete numerous repairs on one of the busiest stretches of highway in Rhode Island, traffic volumes had increased tremendously over the years. The highway designed for 75,000 vehicles a day now carries more than 160,000 cars daily."
PA,12603921-Iway,"The old design had other problems. Tight curves, left-hand exits and closely spaced exits have contributed to excessive congestion on the highway, which spills over onto adjacent highways, causing delays for motorists on I-95, the Route 6/10 connector, and on city streets."
PA,12603921-Iway,"As RIDOT worked on the Iway’s Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in the early 1990s, the highway’s problems were put to paper. The EIS noted deteriorated bridges, substandard roadway alignments, sharp curves and substandard shoulder widths. During the initial stages of the project, DOT worked on a joint project between the School of Architecture at ETH Zürich, and the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), Providence, Rhode Island to include studies of the Iway in their ""Project Providence,"" an exploration of the city through computer visualization."
PA,12603921-Iway,"RIDOT looked at three alternatives before choosing the one that was built. An alignment just to the north of the current highway was not selected as it would have corrected only the congestion and tight curves on I-195 itself. It would not deal with the weaving motorists face due to closely spaced exits at the highway interchange, it would not have addressed better access to the Eddy Street hospitals campus, and it would have created only limited opportunities for redevelopment as outlined in the Old Harbor Plan. The plan outlines how the land occupied by the existing highway will be reused."
PA,12603921-Iway,"Another idea that was considered was a no-build alternative, one in which the existing alignment would be reconstructed. This would have addressed problems with deteriorated structures, but done nothing about the congestion, weaving conflicts and existing safety hazards. Additionally, traffic would have been severely impacted during construction."
PA,12603921-Iway,"Consideration of these choices led RIDOT to choose the alignment south of the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier. Safety problems and congestion issues could be addressed, and the removal of the old highway would allow for significant redevelopment of the Providence waterfront and fuller implementation of the Old Harbor Plan. Also, the redevelopment would complement other projects including the construction of Memorial Boulevard, Waterplace Park and the Riverwalk system, and the Capital Center projects."
H1,12603921-Iway,Roadway openings and closings
PA,12603921-Iway,"On November 4, 2007, the new Iway bridge opened to eastbound traffic from I-95 north to I-195 east. Old exit 20 from I-95 north to I-195 east remained open for access to I-195 exits 1 and 2. I-195 exit 3 eastbound (Gano St.) became accessible from new Iway bridge only. Five days later, a new onramp from Wickenden and Point Streets to I-195 east opened, and the old onramp closed. On May 19, 2008, a temporary onramp to I-195 east from Hoppin street opened, and on May 22, 2008, the eastbound Exit 3 offramp to Gano street closed, while a new eastbound Exit 2 opened from Iway bridge to India Point/Gano Street/Wickenden Street. On May 27, 2008, the Friendship Street onramp to I-195 east closed, followed by the closure of the I-95 north exit 20 to old I-195 east, two days later."
PA,12603921-Iway,"On June 13, 2008, the Pine Street overpass over I-95 closed. On October 15, 2008, the New India Point Park pedestrian bridge over I-195 opened, and on October 29, 2008, a temporary ramp opened from Blackstone Street to I-95 south. On November 7, 2008, the onramp from Broad Street to I-95 south closed. By December 6, 2008, the new exit 20 from I-95 south to the new I-195 east opened, and the new onramp from Plain Street to I-195 east also opened. Then, the old I-195 eastbound roadway was closed, including all on and off ramps from old I-195 eastbound."
PA,12603921-Iway,"On June 18, 2009, the new Iway bridge opened to westbound I-195 traffic to I-95 south, while the old I-195 west remained open to funnel traffic to I-95 north. All ramps to/from old I-195 west also remained open. On October 20, 2009, the new Exit 20 from I-95 NB to Point Street opened, and two days later, the new ramps from the Iway bridge to I-95 north and Point Street (Exit 1A) opened. All I-195 west traffic was now using the new highway and the old I-195, and all remaining on-ramps to it, were closed completely. I-195 WB Exit 2 (South Main St) remained open, however."
PA,12603921-Iway,"On October 13, 2010, the new Clifford Street bridge over I-95 opened, as well as the new entrance ramp to I-95 NB from Point Street. Two weeks later, on October 19, the new exit 19 ramp from I-95 SB to Borden and Eddy Streets opened, while the old exit 19 ramp remained open temporarily. Demolition of the old right of way started on November 15, 2010, and was completed in September 2011. On October 3, 2011, the last major ramp of the project, the new ramp from I-195 West to the R.I. Hospital area, opened."
H1,12603921-Iway,Traffic response
PA,12603921-Iway,"The first few days of the Iway being opened caused lengthy delays for motorists on I-95 South to I-195 East. This was alleviated by several steps RIDOT took. These included combining two on-ramps into one at their merge point with I-195 East, making minor lane adjustments, and a public education campaign to encourage people to get onto I-95 North and then the Iway as opposed to using exits on the old stretch of I-195 where backups were occurring. These changes shifted traffic to the Iway which had excess capacity. In three days traffic was reduced to original evening congestion levels. By the end of the week, congestion had lessened from original levels."
PA,12603921-Iway,The opening of the Iway ramp has eased congestion on I-95 North during the afternoon commute. Originally traffic backed up each evening for approximately . Long traffic backups on this part of I-95 North are unusual except in times of adverse weather or accidents.
LI,12603921-Iway,Iway Bridge Float
PA,12603921-Iway,"A significant milestone was the floating of the new Providence River Bridge from the Quonset Business Park to its final resting place in Providence. In August 2006, RIDOT orchestrated a series of events to install the center span for the bridge. The bridge float captured the attention of Rhode Islanders from all over the state who watched on television and read in newspapers about the entire process of raising the bridge, placing it on Self-Propelled Modular Transporters (SPMTs), rolling it onto two large barges, and floating it up the Bay. The day of the float, thousands of people lined the shores of the Bay to witness history and watch the bridge sail by. The bridge float also attracted the attention of the History Channel, which produced a documentary on the Iway for its “Mega Movers” series."
PA,12603921-Iway,The following is a timeline of the new Providence River Bridge construction and float:
PA,12603921-Iway,"October 2005: Work began on the center span at Pier 2 in the Davisville section of the Quonset Business Park (QBP) in North Kingstown, R.I."
PA,12603921-Iway,March 2006: Cardi Corporation (lead contractor) completed construction of center span.

PA,12603921-Iway,"August 26, 2006: Bridge loaded onto barges and secured for sea voyage."
PA,12603921-Iway,"August 27, 2006: Bridge leaves QBP for Providence. Barges make nearly twice the expected speed and arrive two hours ahead of schedule."
PA,12603921-Iway,"August 28, 2006: Bridge moved into position at new piers and lowered into place."
H1,12603921-Iway,Opening-day ceremonies
PA,12603921-Iway,"The opening of the Iway was preceded by a public walk on the Iway on October 20, 2007. An estimated 10,000 people attended the event from 9 a.m. to noon. Visitors started lining up one hour before the event start time and RIDOT extended the event by about one hour. Visitors traveled to the site on RIPTA buses from one of two satellite parking locations in Providence, from the Johnson & Wales University Harborside Campus and from the State Offices campus. Once there they received a commemorative program and walked the length of the new Providence River Bridge was well as approach ramps on both the east and west side of the bridge."
H1,12603921-Iway,Awards
PA,12603921-Iway,"On June 9, 2008, RIDOT announced that the Iway was nominated for a national award for the Iway bridge float. The competition, America's Transportation Award, is sponsored by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AAA. The contest recognizes transportation projects completed on time, on budget or those that demonstrate innovative management. The latter category is the one RIDOT ran for. On August 13, AASHTO announced that the Iway bridge float was one of 10 finalists for the national award. The Iway bridge received an Innovative Management award in the large project category."
PA,12603921-Iway,"On June 11, 2008, RIDOT was informed that it was the recipient of a ""Bell Ringer"" award from the Publicity Club of New England. The award was for the Iway logo with its three arches and the tag line ""Yours. Mine. Ours."" The award is the highest achievement given by the annual competition, which is the region's premier public relations and communications event."
H1,12603921-Iway,Light pollution
PA,12603921-Iway,"One of the key features of the Iway, the new Providence River Bridge, is illuminated by architectural lighting, making it visible from many points in the city and on the Providence River. There has been criticism that this lighting has caused a considerable amount of light pollution. This has made it difficult for astronomers in the Providence area to view the night sky. Complaints have been made to the state and in response, lights are turned off at 11 p.m. to save energy and reduce light pollution."

PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"The glacier bear (""Ursus americanus emmonsii""), sometimes referred to as the blue bear, is a subspecies of American black bear with silver-blue or gray hair endemic to Southeast Alaska. Little scientific knowledge exists of their total extent and the cause of their unique coloration. Most of the other black bears in southeast Alaska are listed under the subspecies ""Ursus americanus pugnax""."
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"The USDA Forest Service lists"" U. a. emmonsii"" as one of several subspecies of black bears, although no evidence supports the subspecies designation other than hair coloration."
H1,15093458-Glacier-bear,Unique features
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"The chief feature distinguishing the glacier bear from other black bears is its pelage (hair coloration), which ranges from silvery blue to gray. The subspecies was reported by Dall in 1895. This variation can be seen on individual bears that are often lighter on their backs and shoulders, with their legs and belly being much darker or even black."
H1,15093458-Glacier-bear,Habitat and range
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"The glacier bear's habitat ranges has been reported to be the Alaskan coastal areas between Cross Sound and Cape St. Elias and from Prince William Sound to Glacier Bay in southeast Alaska, with a few sightings as far east as Juneau, Alaska, and the Taku River. This region includes Glacier Bay National Park and portions of Tongass National Forest, a temperate rainforest preserve. Few studies document the subspecies' range in association with other black bears. See for instance,"
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"Glacier bears share most of the characteristics of black bears such as their habitat preferences, food sources, size, and reproductive cycles. They prefer forest with thick understory and landscapes with lots of vegetation, but can be found in urban populated areas. The glacier bear habitat is dependent upon food source availability, and they move between forest, meadows, streams, and mountains in search of food and shelter. Black bears in general are very capable climbers and can use trees as a place of protection and refuge. Glacier bears move into their dens in early winter, which can be an overturned tree, a rock ledge, or a cave."
H1,15093458-Glacier-bear,Diet
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"Glacier bears, like all other black bears, are omnivores, with their diets varying depending on the food source available during the season and the location. Their diet includes young shoots and roots in early spring. During the summer in Alaska, the glacier bear eats the abundant Pacific salmon spawning in the streams. In some areas, moose and deer are a food source for black bears. During the fall, the bears eat the starchy roots of ground cones and the variety of berries found in Alaska such as blueberries, salmonberries, raspberries, and cranberries."
H1,15093458-Glacier-bear,Reproduction
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"Breeding habits are much like any other black bear. The glacier bear female normally has her first litter by 3–5 years of age. This breeding period takes place in June through July. Gestation lasts 235 days and cubs are born in January to early February. Because of the increasing range of all subspecies of black bears since the last glacier maximum, interbreeding is taking place. So, it is possible to see a black-colored bear give birth to a bear with the glacier bears' pelage and vice versa."
H1,15093458-Glacier-bear,Research
PA,15093458-Glacier-bear,"Very little is known about this rare color variation, so some potential threats could become an issue for the glacier bear. Some of these threats are overharvesting and gene swamping. Currently, no population projections are made due to the lack of genetic understanding. With the interbreeding capabilities of other black bears with different pelage, determining the future distinctive color variation and population density may become even more complicated. Also, speculation exists that the glacier bear had its origins in hybrids between black bears and grizzlies."

PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"""Proud as a Peacock"" was the advertising campaign used by the NBC television and radio networks from 1979-1981. The campaign was used to promote NBC's programming and to introduce the ""Proud N"", a logo that would be used until 1986."
H1,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,The campaign
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"By 1979, NBC was deeply mired in third place in the Nielsen ratings. Fred Silverman, who joined the network a year earlier, could not bring the same ratings success he had as programming whiz at ABC and CBS, resulting in a string of programs (such as ""Supertrain"") that were derided by critics and/or tuned out by viewers."
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"In an attempt to present a positive image in the face of this failure, Silverman and NBC developed an ad campaign called ""Proud as a Peacock"". The campaign featured a revised version of the famous NBC Peacock logo, billed as the ""Proud N"", along with a catchy high-energy jingle (written for NBC by Joey Levine from Crushing Enterprises) that promotes a network ready to shed its losing reputation and project an image of excitement in its programming. Future R&B singing legend Luther Vandross was among the artists who performed on the jingle."
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"The 1979-1980 season's ""Proud"" campaign promos were produced in New York City for NBC's radio and television networks, and customized versions were produced for the network's affiliates. The campaign was introduced in Summer 1979 to promote the network's Fall lineup, and was used again in the 1980-1981 season with a revised jingle - ""We're Proud!"""
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"Despite the network's effort at ""puttin' on a whole new face"", NBC's difficulties continued unabated. Successes such as ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and the miniseries ""Shogun"" were countered by a flood of failed new programming (such as ""Pink Lady""), which led to near-daily schedule changes. NBC continued to lag in last place behind CBS and ABC, producing only three Nielsen Top 20 shows in both the 1979-1980 and 1980-1981 seasons."
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"NBC was also forced to cancel plans to cover the 1980 Summer Olympics in the wake of the United States' boycott of the Moscow Games, resulting in many millions of dollars lost in rights fees, facility/equipment investments, and potential ad revenue."
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"The continued failures led to ridicule of the ""Proud"" campaign from both within the network and without (see below). Silverman would leave NBC in the summer of 1981; that fall the network adopted a slightly new campaign (""Our Pride Is Showing"") with little difference in ratings. (By the mid-1980s, NBC's fortunes finally began to turn around, due to changes made by Silverman's replacement, Brandon Tartikoff, and his boss, former producer Grant Tinker; they were responsible for such now-legendary programs as ""The Cosby Show"", ""Family Ties"", ""Miami Vice"", ""The Golden Girls"", and ""Cheers"", among many others.)"
H1,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"The ""Loud"" parody"
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"The moves (and failures) of NBC under Fred Silverman’s management generated a feeling of frustration and embarrassment among many of the network’s employees; they were not as proud of the network as the ""Proud"" campaign suggested, and a few inside staffers composed an alternative jingle to express their disappointment."
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"""We're Loud - Proud as a Peacock"" was a radio-style parody of NBC's 1980-1981 ""We're Proud"" campaign, recorded by the same production studio the network employed for ""Proud"" and using the same voice cast used for the original ""Proud"" campaign. ""Loud"" voiced the disappointment that many of NBC's employees felt under Silverman's leadership. The jingle was widely circulated to network staff and even sent out to local affiliates on cassettes as a joke at Christmastime."
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"The joke ended when Don Imus, then the morning host at WNBC radio in New York City, played the parody on-air. Angered by Imus' move, Silverman ordered a search-and-destroy mission to purge the network of any remaining copies of the parody. However, many copies remained, albeit poor audio quality and not fit for broadcast. However, just as how ""Proud as a Peacock"" was parodied, so was ""Our Pride Is Showing"". It was spoofed at the beginning of a 1981 episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" as ""Our Age Is Showing"" and the spoof featured an aged and deoriented NBC logo. ""Proud as a Peacock"" was also parodied at the beginning of a 1979 episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" as ""Smart as a Peacock"", which was meant as a way for SNL staff to ridicule NBC for causing SNL's disputes and problems during that time."
H1,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,Meaning of the phrase
PA,1531305-Proud-as-a-Peacock,"""Proud as a peacock"" is a saying that is used to mean a vain or self-centered person. The phrase comes from the plumage of the male peafowl (females are peahens). When a male is courting, he spreads his tail feathers, sometimes five feet in length, out in a fan pattern to attract a female. Thus, someone who is ""proud as a peacock"" is similarly ""strutting his stuff""."

LI,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Hydrogen peroxide
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula . In its pure form, it is a pale blue, clear liquid, slightly more viscous than water. Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygen–oxygen single bond). It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent and antiseptic. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or ""high-test peroxide"", is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry. Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is unstable and slowly decomposes in the presence of light. Because of its instability, hydrogen peroxide is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution. Hydrogen peroxide is found in biological systems including the human body. Enzymes that use or decompose hydrogen peroxide are classified as peroxidases."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Properties
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The boiling point of has been extrapolated as being 150.2 °C, approximately 50 °C higher than water. In practice, hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature. It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Aqueous solutions
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"In aqueous solutions hydrogen peroxide differs from the pure material due to the effects of hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules. Hydrogen peroxide and water form a eutectic mixture, exhibiting freezing-point depression; pure water has a freezing point of 0 °C and pure hydrogen peroxide of −0.43 °C. The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points (125.1 °C). It occurs at 114 °C. This boiling point is 14 °C greater than that of pure water and 36.2 °C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Structure
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide () is a nonplanar molecule as shown by Paul-Antoine Giguère in 1950 using infrared spectroscopy, with (twisted) C symmetry. Although the O−O bond is a single bond, the molecule has a relatively high rotational barrier of 2460 cm (29.45 kJ/mol); for comparison, the rotational barrier for ethane is 12.5 kJ/mol. The increased barrier is ascribed to repulsion between the lone pairs of the adjacent oxygen atoms and results in hydrogen peroxide displaying atropisomerism."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline are significantly different. This difference is attributed to the effects of hydrogen bonding, which is absent in the gaseous state. Crystals of are tetragonal with the space group ""D""""P""42."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Comparison with analogues
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide has several structural analogues with H−X−X−H bonding arrangements (water also shown for comparison). It has the highest (theoretical) boiling point of this series (X = O, N, S). Its melting point is also fairly high, being comparable to that of hydrazine and water, with only hydroxylamine crystallising significantly more readily, indicative of particularly strong hydrogen bonding. Diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide exhibit only weak hydrogen bonding and have little chemical similarity to hydrogen peroxide. All of these analogues are thermodynamically unstable. Structurally, the analogues all adopt similar skewed structures, due to repulsion between adjacent lone pairs."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Discovery
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Alexander von Humboldt synthesized one of the first synthetic peroxides, barium peroxide, in 1799 as a by-product of his attempts to decompose air."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Nineteen years later Louis Jacques Thénard recognized that this compound could be used for the preparation of a previously unknown compound, which he described as ""eau oxygénée"" (French: oxygenated water) – subsequently known as hydrogen peroxide. (Today this term refers instead to water containing dissolved oxygen (O).)"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"An improved version of Thénard's process used hydrochloric acid, followed by addition of sulfuric acid to precipitate the barium sulfate byproduct. This process was used from the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Thénard and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac synthesized sodium peroxide in 1811. The bleaching effect of peroxides and their salts on natural dyes became known around that time, but early attempts of industrial production of peroxides failed, and the first plant producing hydrogen peroxide was built in 1873 in Berlin. The discovery of the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by electrolysis with sulfuric acid introduced the more efficient electrochemical method. It was first implemented into industry in 1908 in Weißenstein, Carinthia, Austria. The anthraquinone process, which is still used, was developed during the 1930s by the German chemical manufacturer IG Farben in Ludwigshafen. The increased demand and improvements in the synthesis methods resulted in the rise of the annual production of hydrogen peroxide from 35,000 tonnes in 1950, to over 100,000 tonnes in 1960, to 300,000 tonnes by 1970; by 1998 it reached 2.7 million tonnes."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Pure hydrogen peroxide was long believed to be unstable, as early attempts to separate it from the water, which is present during synthesis, all failed. This instability was due to traces of impurities (transition-metal salts), which catalyze the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. Pure hydrogen peroxide was first obtained in 1894—almost 80 years after its discovery—by Richard Wolffenstein, who produced it by vacuum distillation."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Determination of the molecular structure of hydrogen peroxide proved to be very difficult. In 1892 the Italian physical chemist Giacomo Carrara (1864–1925) determined its molecular mass by freezing-point depression, which confirmed that its molecular formula is HO. At least half a dozen hypothetical molecular structures seemed to be consistent with the available evidence. In 1934, the English mathematical physicist William Penney and the Scottish physicist Gordon Sutherland proposed a molecular structure for hydrogen peroxide that was very similar to the presently accepted one."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Production
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Previously, hydrogen peroxide was prepared industrially by hydrolysis of ammonium persulfate, which was itself obtained by the electrolysis of a solution of ammonium bisulfate () in sulfuric acid:"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Today, hydrogen peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939. It begins with the reduction of an anthraquinone (such as 2-ethylanthraquinone or the 2-amyl derivative) to the corresponding anthrahydroquinone, typically by hydrogenation on a palladium catalyst. In the presence of oxygen, the anthrahydroquinone then undergoes autoxidation: the labile hydrogen atoms of the hydroxy groups transfer to the oxygen molecule, to give hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone. Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling compressed air through a solution of the anthrahydroquinone, with the hydrogen peroxide then extracted from the solution and the anthraquinone recycled back for successive cycles of hydrogenation and oxidation."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,The simplified overall equation for the process is simple:
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The economics of the process depend heavily on effective recycling of the extraction solvents, the hydrogenation catalyst and the expensive quinone."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"A process to produce hydrogen peroxide directly from the elements has been of interest for many years. Direct synthesis is difficult to achieve, as the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen thermodynamically favours production of water. Systems for direct synthesis have been developed, most of which are based around finely dispersed metal catalysts similar to those used for hydrogenation of organic substrates. None of these has yet reached a point where they can be used for industrial-scale synthesis."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Availability
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is most commonly available as a solution in water. For consumers, it is usually available from pharmacies at 3 and 6 wt% concentrations. The concentrations are sometimes described in terms of the volume of oxygen gas generated; one milliliter of a 20-volume solution generates twenty milliliters of oxygen gas when completely decomposed. For laboratory use, 30 wt% solutions are most common. Commercial grades from 70% to 98% are also available, but due to the potential of solutions of more than 68% hydrogen peroxide to be converted entirely to steam and oxygen (with the temperature of the steam increasing as the concentration increases above 68%) these grades are potentially far more hazardous and require special care in dedicated storage areas. Buyers must typically allow inspection by commercial manufacturers."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"In 1994, world production of was around 1.9 million tonnes and grew to 2.2 million in 2006, most of which was at a concentration of 70% or less. In that year bulk 30% sold for around 0.54 USD/kg, equivalent to US$1.50/kg (US$0.68/lb) on a ""100% basis""."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide occurs in surface water, groundwater and in the atmosphere. It forms upon illumination or natural catalytic action by substances contained in water. Sea water contains 0.5 to 14 μg/L of hydrogen peroxide, freshwater 1 to 30 μg/L and air 0.1 to 1 parts per billion."

LI,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,<chem> 2H2O2 -> 2H2O + O2 </chem>
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The rate of decomposition increases with rising temperature, concentration and pH, with cool, dilute, acidic solutions showing the best stability. Decomposition is catalysed by various compounds, including most transition metals and their compounds (e.g. manganese dioxide, silver, and platinum). Certain metal ions, such as or , can cause the decomposition to take a different path, with free radicals such as (HO·) and (HOO·) being formed. Non-metallic catalysts include potassium iodide, which reacts particularly rapidly and forms the basis of the elephant toothpaste experiment. Hydrogen peroxide can also be decomposed biologically by the enzyme catalase. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide liberates oxygen and heat; this can be dangerous, as spilling high-concentration hydrogen peroxide on a flammable substance can cause an immediate fire."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Redox reactions
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide exhibits oxidizing and reducing properties, depending on pH."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"In acidic solutions, is one of the most powerful oxidizers known, when used for removing organic stains from laboratory glassware it is referred to as Piranha solution and is stronger than chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and potassium permanganate. Also, through catalysis, can be converted into hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which are highly reactive."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,In acidic solutions is oxidized to (hydrogen peroxide acting as an oxidizing agent):
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"and sulfite () is oxidized to sulfate (). However, potassium permanganate is reduced to by acidic . Under alkaline conditions, however, some of these reactions reverse; for example, is oxidized to (as )."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"In basic solution, hydrogen peroxide can reduce a variety of inorganic ions. When it acts as a reducing agent, oxygen gas is also produced. For example, hydrogen peroxide will reduce sodium hypochlorite and potassium permanganate, which is a convenient method for preparing oxygen in the laboratory:"
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Organic reactions
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Hydrogen peroxide is frequently used as an oxidizing agent. Illustrative is oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides:
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Alkaline hydrogen peroxide is used for epoxidation of electron-deficient alkenes such as acrylic acid derivatives, and for the oxidation of alkylboranes to alcohols, the second step of hydroboration-oxidation. It is also the principal reagent in the Dakin oxidation process."
LI,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Precursor to other peroxide compounds
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is a weak acid, forming hydroperoxide or peroxide salts with many metals."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"It also converts metal oxides into the corresponding peroxides. For example, upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, chromic acid( + ) forms an unstable blue peroxide CrO(."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"This kind of reaction is used industrially to produce peroxoanions. For example, reaction with borax leads to sodium perborate, a bleach used in laundry detergents:"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The peroxide anion is a stronger nucleophile than hydroxide and displaces hydroxyl from oxyanions e.g. forming perborates and percarbonates. Sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate are important consumer and industrial bleaching agents; they stabilize hydrogen peroxide and limit side reactions (e.g. reduction and decomposition note below). The peroxide anion forms an adduct with urea, hydrogen peroxide–urea."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is both an oxidizing agent and reducing agent. The oxidation of hydrogen peroxide by sodium hypochlorite yields singlet oxygen. The net reaction of a ferric ion with hydrogen peroxide is a ferrous ion and oxygen. This proceeds via single electron oxidation and hydroxyl radicals. This is used in some organic chemistry oxidations, e.g. in the Fenton's reagent. Only catalytic quantities of iron ion is needed since peroxide also oxidizes ferrous to ferric ion. The net reaction of hydrogen peroxide and permanganate or manganese dioxide is manganous ion; however, until the peroxide is spent some manganous ions are reoxidized to make the reaction catalytic. This forms the basis for common monopropellant rockets."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Biological function
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is formed in human and animals as a short-lived product in biochemical processes and is toxic to cells. The toxicity is due to oxidation of proteins, membrane lipids and DNA by the peroxide ions. The class of biological enzymes called SOD (superoxide dismutase) is developed in nearly all living cells as an important antioxidant agent. They promote the disproportionation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then rapidly decomposed by the enzyme catalase to oxygen and water."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Peroxisomes are organelles found in virtually all eukaryotic cells. They are involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, -amino acids, polyamines, and biosynthesis of plasmalogens, etherphospholipids critical for the normal function of mammalian brains and lungs. Upon oxidation, they produce hydrogen peroxide in the following process:"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Catalase, another peroxisomal enzyme, uses this HO to oxidize other substrates, including phenols, formic acid, formaldehyde, and alcohol, by means of the peroxidation reaction:"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"This reaction is important in liver and kidney cells, where the peroxisomes neutralize various toxic substances that enter the blood. Some of the ethanol humans drink is oxidized to acetaldehyde in this way. In addition, when excess HO accumulates in the cell, catalase converts it to HO through this reaction:"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Another origin of hydrogen peroxide is the degradation of adenosine monophosphate which yields hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is then oxidatively catabolized first to xanthine and then to uric acid, and the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase:"
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,The degradation of guanosine monophosphate yields xanthine as an intermediate product which is then converted in the same way to uric acid with the formation of hydrogen peroxide.
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Eggs of sea urchin, shortly after fertilization by a sperm, produce hydrogen peroxide. It is then quickly dissociated to OH· radicals. The radicals serve as initiator of radical polymerization, which surrounds the eggs with a protective layer of polymer."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The bombardier beetle has a device which allows it to shoot corrosive and foul-smelling bubbles at its enemies. The beetle produces and stores hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, in two separate reservoirs in the rear tip of its abdomen. When threatened, the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through valved tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and a mixture of catalytic enzymes. When combined, the reactants undergo a violent exothermic chemical reaction, raising the temperature to near the boiling point of water. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a gas (flash evaporation) and is expelled through an outlet valve with a loud popping sound."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Hydrogen peroxide is a signaling molecule of plant defense against pathogens.
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide has roles as a signalling molecule in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes. The compound is a major factor implicated in the free-radical theory of aging, based on how readily hydrogen peroxide can decompose into a hydroxyl radical and how superoxide radical byproducts of cellular metabolism can react with ambient water to form hydrogen peroxide. These hydroxyl radicals in turn readily react with and damage vital cellular components, especially those of the mitochondria. At least one study has also tried to link hydrogen peroxide production to cancer. These studies have frequently been quoted in fraudulent treatment claims."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,The amount of hydrogen peroxide in biological systems can be assayed using a fluorometric assay.

H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Production of organic compounds
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"It is used in the production of various organic peroxides with dibenzoyl peroxide being a high volume example. It is used in polymerisations, as a flour bleaching agent and as a treatment for acne. Peroxy acids, such as peracetic acid and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid are also produced using hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has been used for creating organic peroxide-based explosives, such as acetone peroxide."
LI,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Disinfectant
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is used in certain waste-water treatment processes to remove organic impurities. In advanced oxidation processing, the Fenton reaction gives the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (·OH). This degrades organic compounds, including those that are ordinarily robust, such as aromatic or halogenated compounds. It can also oxidize sulfur based compounds present in the waste; which is beneficial as it generally reduces their odour."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide can be used for the sterilization of various surfaces, including surgical tools and may be deployed as a vapour (VHP) for room sterilization. HO demonstrates broad-spectrum efficacy against viruses, bacteria, yeasts, and bacterial spores. In general, greater activity is seen against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria; however, the presence of catalase or other peroxidases in these organisms can increase tolerance in the presence of lower concentrations. Higher concentrations of HO (10 to 30%) and longer contact times are required for sporicidal activity."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is seen as an environmentally safe alternative to chlorine-based bleaches, as it degrades to form oxygen and water and it is generally recognized as safe as an antimicrobial agent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Historically hydrogen peroxide was used for disinfecting wounds, partly because of its low cost and prompt availability compared to other antiseptics. It is now thought to inhibit healing and to induce scarring because it destroys newly formed skin cells. Only a very low concentration of HO can induce healing, and only if not repeatedly applied. Surgical use can lead to gas embolism formation. Despite this, it is still used for wound treatment in many developing countries."

PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Diluted (between 1.9% and 12%) mixed with ammonium hydroxide is used to bleach human hair. The chemical's bleaching property lends its name to the phrase ""peroxide blonde""."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Hydrogen peroxide is also used for tooth whitening. It can be found in most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide may be used to treat acne, although benzoyl peroxide is a more common treatment."
LI,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Use in alternative medicine
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Practitioners of alternative medicine have advocated the use of hydrogen peroxide for various conditions, including emphysema, influenza, AIDS and cancer, although there is no evidence of effectiveness and in some cases it may even be fatal."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The practice calls for the daily consumption of hydrogen peroxide, either orally or by injection and is, in general, based around two precepts. First, that hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body to combat infection; and second, that human pathogens (including cancer: See Warburg hypothesis) are anaerobic and cannot survive in oxygen-rich environments. The ingestion or injection of hydrogen peroxide is therefore believed to kill disease by mimicking the immune response in addition to increasing levels of oxygen within the body. This makes it similar to other oxygen-based therapies, such as ozone therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Both the effectiveness and safety of hydrogen peroxide therapy is scientifically questionable. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the immune system but in a carefully controlled manner. Cells called phagocytes engulf pathogens and then use hydrogen peroxide to destroy them. The peroxide is toxic to both the cell and the pathogen and so is kept within a special compartment, called a phagosome. Free hydrogen peroxide will damage any tissue it encounters via oxidative stress; a process which also has been proposed as a cause of cancer."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Claims that hydrogen peroxide therapy increases cellular levels of oxygen have not been supported. The quantities administered would be expected to provide very little additional oxygen compared to that available from normal respiration. It should also be noted that it is difficult to raise the level of oxygen around cancer cells within a tumour, as the blood supply tends to be poor, a situation known as tumor hypoxia."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Large oral doses of hydrogen peroxide at a 3% concentration may cause irritation and blistering to the mouth, throat, and abdomen as well as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Intravenous injection of hydrogen peroxide has been linked to several deaths.
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The American Cancer Society states that ""there is no scientific evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a safe, effective or useful cancer treatment."" Furthermore, the therapy is not approved by the U.S. FDA."
H2,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Propellant
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"High-concentration is referred to as ""high-test peroxide"" (HTP). It can be used either as a monopropellant (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a bipropellant rocket. Use as a monopropellant takes advantage of the decomposition of 70–98% concentration hydrogen peroxide into steam and oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a reaction chamber, where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over , which is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. monopropellant produces a maximal specific impulse (""I"") of 161 s (1.6 kN·s/kg). Peroxide was the first major monopropellant adopted for use in rocket applications. Hydrazine eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide monopropellant thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse. Hydrazine (toxic) and hydrogen peroxide (less-toxic [ACGIH TLV 0.01 and 1 ppm respectively]) are the only two monopropellants (other than cold gases) to have been widely adopted and utilized for propulsion and power applications. The Bell Rocket Belt, reaction control systems for X-1, X-15, Centaur, Mercury, Little Joe, as well as the turbo-pump gas generators for X-1, X-15, Jupiter, Redstone and Viking used hydrogen peroxide as a monopropellant."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"As a bipropellant, is decomposed to burn a fuel as an oxidizer. Specific impulses as high as 350 s (3.5 kN·s/kg) can be achieved, depending on the fuel. Peroxide used as an oxidizer gives a somewhat lower ""I"" than liquid oxygen, but is dense, storable, noncryogenic and can be more easily used to drive gas turbines to give high pressures using an efficient ""closed cycle"". It can also be used for regenerative cooling of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. T-Stoff, containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the Walter HWK 109-500 ""Starthilfe"" RATO externally podded monopropellant booster system, and for the Walter HWK 109-509 rocket motor series used for the Me 163B), most often used with C-Stoff in a self-igniting hypergolic combination, and for the low-cost British Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"In the 1940s and 1950s, the Hellmuth Walter KG-conceived turbine used hydrogen peroxide for use in submarines while submerged; it was found to be too noisy and require too much maintenance compared to diesel-electric power systems. Some torpedoes used hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer or propellant. Operator error in the use of hydrogen-peroxide torpedoes was named as possible causes for the sinkings of HMS ""Sidon"" and the Russian submarine ""Kursk"". SAAB Underwater Systems is manufacturing the Torpedo 2000. This torpedo, used by the Swedish Navy, is powered by a piston engine propelled by HTP as an oxidizer and kerosene as a fuel in a bipropellant system."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Other uses
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide has various domestic uses, primarily as a cleaning and disinfecting agent."
LI,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Glow sticks
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide reacts with certain di-esters, such as phenyl oxalate ester (cyalume), to produce chemiluminescence; this application is most commonly encountered in the form of glow sticks."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Horticulture:
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Some horticulturalists and users of hydroponics advocate the use of weak hydrogen peroxide solution in watering solutions. Its spontaneous decomposition releases oxygen that enhances a plant's root development and helps to treat root rot (cellular root death due to lack of oxygen) and a variety of other pests.
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Fish aeration
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Laboratory tests conducted by fish culturists in recent years have demonstrated that common household hydrogen peroxide can be used safely to provide oxygen for small fish. The hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen by decomposition when it is exposed to catalysts such as manganese dioxide.
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Safety
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Regulations vary, but low concentrations, such as 6%, are widely available and legal to buy for medical use. Most over-the-counter peroxide solutions are not suitable for ingestion. Higher concentrations may be considered hazardous and are typically accompanied by a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). In high concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is an aggressive oxidizer and will corrode many materials, including human skin. In the presence of a reducing agent, high concentrations of will react violently."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"High-concentration hydrogen peroxide streams, typically above 40%, should be considered hazardous due to concentrated hydrogen peroxide's meeting the definition of a DOT oxidizer according to U.S. regulations, if released into the environment. The EPA Reportable Quantity (RQ) for D001 hazardous wastes is , or approximately , of concentrated hydrogen peroxide."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area and away from any flammable or combustible substances. It should be stored in a container composed of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable). Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should be stored in an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide, either in pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms explosive mixtures upon contact with organic compounds. Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide itself is unstable and can cause a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) of the remaining liquid. Distillation of hydrogen peroxide at normal pressures is thus highly dangerous. It is also corrosive, especially when concentrated, but even domestic-strength solutions can cause irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Swallowing hydrogen peroxide solutions is particularly dangerous, as decomposition in the stomach releases large quantities of gas (10 times the volume of a 3% solution), leading to internal bloating. Inhaling over 10% can cause severe pulmonary irritation."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"With a significant vapour pressure (1.2 kPa at 50 °C), hydrogen-peroxide vapour is potentially hazardous. According to U.S. NIOSH, the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) limit is only 75 ppm. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established a permissible exposure limit of 1.0 ppm calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1). Hydrogen peroxide has also been classified by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) as a ""known animal carcinogen, with unknown relevance on humans"". For workplaces where there is a risk of exposure to the hazardous concentrations of the vapours, continuous monitors for hydrogen peroxide should be used. Information on the hazards of hydrogen peroxide is available from OSHA and from the ATSDR."
H1,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Historical incidents
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"On 16 July 1934, in Kummersdorf, Germany, a propellant tank containing an experimental monopropellant mixture consisting of hydrogen peroxide and ethanol exploded during a test, killing three people."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"During the Second World War, doctors in German concentration camps experimented with the use of hydrogen peroxide injections in the killing of human subjects."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,Several people received minor injuries after a hydrogen peroxide spill on board a flight between the U.S. cities of Orlando and Memphis on 28 October 1998.
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"The Russian submarine K-141 ""Kursk"" sailed to perform an exercise of firing dummy torpedoes at the Pyotr Velikiy, a ""Kirov""-class battlecruiser. On 12 August 2000, at 11:28 local time (07:28 UTC), there was an explosion while preparing to fire the torpedoes. The only credible report to date is that this was due to the failure and explosion of one of the Kursk's hydrogen peroxide-fueled torpedoes. It is believed that HTP, a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide used as propellant for the torpedo, seeped through its container, damaged either by rust or in the loading procedure back on land where an incident involving one of the torpedoes accidentally touching ground went unreported. The vessel was lost with all hands. A similar incident was responsible for the loss of HMS ""Sidon"" in 1955."
PA,14403-Hydrogen-peroxide,"On 15 August 2010, a spill of about of cleaning fluid occurred on the 54th floor of 1515 Broadway, in Times Square, New York City. The spill, which a spokesperson for the New York City fire department said was of hydrogen peroxide, shut down Broadway between West 42nd and West 48th streets as fire engines responded to the hazmat situation. There were no reported injuries."

PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"Raven Rise is the ninth book in The Pendragon Adventure by D.J. MacHale. It was published on May 20, 2008."
H1,14024913-Raven-Rise,Synopsis
PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"The book begins with separate narratives focusing on Patrick Mac and Alder, the Travelers of Third Earth and Denduron respectively. It follows the changes in their home territories and their realization that they are without Bobby Pendragon. On Denduron, the Bedoowan and Milago tribe are using the explosive tak that Bobby unearthed with a dygo from Zadaa to start a war with a neighboring tribe, the Lowsee tribe. On Third Earth, the once Utopian planet has morphed into a waste world. Bobby Pendragon, meanwhile, has been living comfortably on Ibara, the island community located on Veelox. Pendragon's own description states that he has been a contributor and leader of the rebuilding of Ibara, which was destroyed in the previous book by Saint Dane's Dimond Alpha Digital Organization D.A.D.O.army. Days after an unsettling conversation with Saint Dane, Pendragon encounters a drifting skimmer bearing a dying passenger on board (this passenger being Loque, one of the Jakills from The Pilgrims of Rayne who amazingly survived having a large amount of broken glass fall on him and slaving underneath Saint Dane while trying to dig up the flume in Rubic City along with the other Flighters). After hearing Loque's story, Bobby assumes that Saint Dane is after the flume and decides to prevent the flume from being reopened. He fails, and later discovers that Nevva Winter, Saint Dane's ally, has been living on Ibara disguised as Tribune Genj's daughter, Telleo, whom she killed months before. Hearing from her that Denduron is in danger, Bobby reluctantly sets out to rescue it."
PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"Emerging onto Denduron, Pendragon is nearly killed by a quig, later to be healed by Alder, whom he rescues from prison. Later, after failing to reseal the newly opened tak mine, the two of them realize that the territory is lost; therefore they travel to Second Earth to battle Saint Dane."
PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"On First Earth (1937) Mark and Courtney find that they have failed to prevent Mark's inventions from altering Earth's history. Mark is then black-mailed into giving up his Traveler ring to Nevva. They then head to the flume only to be intercepted by Patrick who came to First Earth in search of Bobby after realizing he couldn't save Third Earth alone. Mark and Courtney then return to Second Earth with Patrick in tow. Upon arriving they find that many people are worshiping a new cult, Ravinia, and both flumes have been revealed by Alexander Naymeer who is the leader of Ravinia and the ""new"" traveler of Second Earth as Bobby has quit. He is using the ring Nevva took from Mark. The goal of Ravinia is to reward the people who contribute to society, while punishing those who do not. Mark, Courtney, and Patrick head to the other flume to get off of Second Earth only to be intercepted by Naymeer. A chase ensues and Patrick narrowly gets away but not before being shot. Mark and Courtney are captured and brought to Naymeer's home which happens to be on top of one of the flumes, in the Sherwood house."
PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"A mortally wounded Patrick arrives on Denduron just as Alder and Bobby are about to leave. They heal him and send him back to Third Earth to find out what a possible Second Earth turning point could be. They then head to Second Earth to find Mark and Courtney. Bobby comes out in the flume below Naymeer's house. Just before Bobby arrives, Naymeer tells Mark and Courtney that the flumes and Traveler rings are made of dark matter. Bobby, Alder, Mark, and Courtney all talk with Naymeer who tells them he can't be stopped. They disagree and escape to Courtney's family's boat where they all decide that a vote to nominate Ravinia as ""spiritual advisor"" to the entire world is the turning point of Second Earth. Courtney's parents then show up with the cops. Another chase ensues and Mark and Courtney are captured but Bobby and Alder escape and take refuge with the main protester of Ravinia, Haig Gastigian."
PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"Patrick, on Third Earth, learns that the destruction there has begun with a mostly forgotten event known as the Bronx Massacre. He is killed while trying to convey word of this, but succeeds in telling Bobby about the event by sending him a message through his ring. Bobby and Alder witness what they think is the Bronx Massacre when Naymeer sends 12 people, including Mark and Courtney, into the flume to an unknown destination. Bobby and Alder later hear from Haig Gastigian, that he is holding a rally of 70,000 people in Yankee Stadium. At the rally the UN's vote is revealed to favor Ravinia, whereupon the 70,000 protesters gathered in Yankee Stadium are pulled into a giant flume which Naymeer creates, causing the true Bronx Massacre. Alder tries to stop him, but is killed in the process. Bobby is brought to a helicopter and flown above the stadium to witness everyone's deaths. It is revealed that Haig Gastigian was really Nevva who lured all the people to the stadium. Realizing this, Bobby throws Naymeer into the flume. At this, Saint Dane claims victory because Bobby had stooped to his level and failed his last test. Naymeer, falling into the flume, causes a beam of light to strike the helicopter. It spins out of control and falls into the flume. Saint Dane and Nevva escape and later tell the Conclave of Ravinia, the head of Ravinia, that Naymeer is dead but that Nevva is trained to take his place."
PA,14024913-Raven-Rise,"Bobby then finds himself in space, looking down at the flumes, and watches them explode. He wakes up in the middle of an oblivious landscape, where he is confronted by his Uncle Press and the other nine travelers of his generation, both dead and alive. Uncle Press says that now is the right time to kill Saint Dane, since he believes that he has won. He also says that it is time for the current Travelers to learn the truth about themselves. The Travelers decide to finish the fight with Saint Dane, once and for all."

LI,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Timmy Person, Jeanette Webb"
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"The Battle of Ekeren, June 30, 1703 was a battle of the War of the Spanish Succession. The French surrounded a Dutch force, which barely avoided destruction. This battle ended hope of a decisive allied victory in the Spanish Netherlands in 1703."
H1,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,Prelude
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"After taking Bonn on May 15, Marlborough now wanted to conquer Ostend, Antwerp, or force the French to an open battle. He ordered the Dutch general, Coehoorn, to march to Ostend and lay siege to it. Dutch general Van Sparre would march south west of Antwerp, Dutch general Obdam would march south from Bergen op Zoom, and Marlborough himself would march on Lier."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"The United Provinces, however, were not keen to open the ports of Antwerp and Ostend to English commerce and thus to their competition with the Dutch. Therefore, Coehoorn did not besiege Ostend, but plundered the countryside between Ostend and Antwerp."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Obdam marched on June 28 from Bergen op Zoom to Antwerp, arriving the next day at Ekeren, seven kilometres from Antwerp."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Villeroi was not misled by Marlborough's diversionary manoeuver, and sent all his troops from Diest to Antwerp to protect it. After hearing of this Marlborough tried to warn Obdam, ordering a withdrawal to Lillo, but he was too late."
H1,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,The battle
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Early in the morning of June 30, French dragoons marched from Merksem and Ekeren in the direction of Kapellen to cut off the escape route near Hoevenen for the Dutch to return to Breda and Bergen-op-Zoom. The Marquis of Bedmar and his Spanish troops were positioned near Wilmarsdonk. This ensured that the Dutch forces were surrounded on all sides by a superior force."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Soon Dutch reconnaissance discovered the French dragoons and Obdam immediately sent his cavalry to Hoevenen, but it was too late, the village was packed with French troops. An attempt to conquer neighboring Muisbroek also failed. Then the French attacked, and Obdam tried to take Oorderen, an attack which was briefly successful before the French retook the village."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"The fighting went on for the entire day. By eight o'clock there was no more sign of Obdam, and Slangenburg decided to attempt an attack on Oorderen, this time by a surprise bayonet charge led by Friesheim. Friesheim sent his men wading through the water, appearing where the French had not expected them to. This action enabled the remaining Dutch troops to break through and retreat in the darkness towards the Netherlands."
H1,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,Aftermath
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"The battle was a victory for the French, but Boufflers wasn't congratulated at all, he was blamed for letting the chance of a total victory slip through his fingers."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Obdam survived and escaped south in the afternoon with thirty horsemen, disguising themselves as Frenchmen. His behaviour was not forgiven by the Dutch military, and his military career was destroyed."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"Slangenburg, for his part, was acclaimed as a Dutch hero. He was also furious at Marlborough, who had been outmanoeuvered by the French and had not come to the aid of the Dutch."
PA,10127565-Battle-of-Ekeren,"The Dutch lost 1,717 killed, 1,003 wounded, and 694 who were prisoners of war or were missing.<br> The French and Spaniards lost 1,750 men."

TI,12406231-Søndermarken,Memorial Mound
PA,12406231-Søndermarken,"The Memorial Mound is on a slope and was erected in 1925 to commemorate Danish immigration to America. In the 1920s, Danish-Americans in the United States conceived the idea to erect a memorial in Copenhagen as a counterpoint to the traditions surrounding Rebild Hills celebrations in Jutland."
PA,12406231-Søndermarken,"A committee of Danish-Americans was set up which charged the sculptor Anders Bundgaard with the commission. After prolonged discussions, it was ultimately decided that the monument should be a mound, with an embellished inner chamber, placed in Søndermarken."
PA,12406231-Søndermarken,"The necessary funds were raised through a worldwide collection among expatriate Danes. Around $12,000 was collected and the monument was inaugurated in 1925 with a ceremony attended by 40,000 people, including the entire Danish royal family."
PA,12406231-Søndermarken,"The mound measures 8 metres in diameter and is 5 metres tall. It is surrounded by tall trees and is reached along a narrow stone-lined passageway. Chiselled above the entrance is the inscription: ""They who set out, never to return."" At the top of the cupola is a metre-wide opening to let in daylight. At the centre of the room is the life-size figure of a woman who embraces her children, symbolizing Mother Denmark. Built into the wall are 9 bas-reliefs with symbolic descriptions of the emigrants’ lives and activities abroad. In the floor is a five-pointed star representing the five continents."

PA,12010325-South-Central-Oklahoma,"South Central Oklahoma is an amorphous region in the state of Oklahoma, perhaps encompassing 10 counties. It is centered on the Arbuckle Mountains, an ancient, eroded range traversing some across the region, and surrounded by rivers and lakes, notably Lake Texoma, Lake Murray and Lake of the Arbuckles. For tourism purposes, the Oklahoma Department of Tourism has more narrowly defined South Central Oklahoma, which they refer to as Chickasaw Country, as being a seven-county region including Pontotoc, Johnston, Marshall, Garvin, Murray, Carter, and Love counties. A ten-county definition might also include Coal, Atoka, and Bryan counties, although the Department of Tourism includes those in Choctaw Country. The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma covers the eastern third of the region. Its headquarters is in Durant, and its capitol building, now a museum, is in Tuskahoma. The Chickasaw Nation lies within the region, with the tribal capitol building located at Tishomingo and its headquarters in Ada. The Chickasaw Nation, which runs , promotes the idea of Chickasaw Country as the 13 south-central Oklahoma counties that comprise the Chickasaw Nation, being the Tourism Department’s seven counties plus Coal, Bryan, Jefferson, Stephens, Grady, and McClain counties."

Department of Tourism designation, Arbuckle Country or Lake and Trail Country, has three distinct centers of commerce and culture, Ardmore, Ada and Durant, though it retains a largely rural nature, and is populated with many small towns and ranches. It also contains a large portion of the Cross Timbers region, transitioning from a heavily wooded area (with native oaks, elms and other eastern varieties) to a rolling savanna in the west, occasionally broken by cedar and mesquite trees. In addition to abundant water resources latent in the Arbuckle-Simpson Aquifer, the region has some of the highest oil & gas production in the state, with Carter County seated as the largest producer in the state."

LI,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,Kristy Nicholson
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"North Dakota's climate is typical of a continental climate with cold winters and warm-hot summers. The state's location in the Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, and each of the four seasons has its own distinct characteristics. The eastern half of the state has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification ""Dfb"") with warm to hot, somewhat humid summers and cold, windy winters, while the western half has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification """"BSk"""") with less precipitation and less humidity but similar temperature profiles. The areas east of the Missouri River get slightly colder winters, while those west of the stream get higher summer daytime temperatures. In general, the diurnal temperature difference is prone to be more significant in the west due to higher elevation and less humidity."
H1,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,General climatology
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"Due to its location in the center of North America North Dakota experiences temperature extremes characteristic of a continental climate, with cold winters and hot summers. Each season has distinctive upper air patterns which bring different weather conditions with them. One feature of a continental climate is that weather patterns can be unpredictable. For example, an Alberta clipper, a low pressure system originating in the province of Alberta in Canada, would be a common winter occurrence in North Dakota. But with the general unpredictability of weather in a continental climate, such a storm system could occur in spring, or in late autumn. Hot weather, though usually confined to July and August, can sometimes begin as early as April or May, and could spill over into September or October."
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"Being from any large body of water (with the exception of Lake Superior), temperatures and precipitation in North Dakota can vary widely. North Dakota is far enough north to experience −60 °F (−51 °C) temperatures and blizzards during the winter months, but far enough south to experience 121 °F (49 °C) temperatures and tornado outbreaks in the summer. The 181 °F degree (100 °C) variation between North Dakota's highest and lowest temperature is the 3rd largest variation of any U.S. State, and the largest of any non-mountainous state."
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"North Dakota is far from major sources of moisture and is in the transition zone between the moist East and the semi-arid West, as precipitation and humidity decrease from east to west. Annual average precipitation across the state ranges from around 14 in (35.6 cm) in the west to 22 in (55.9 cm) in the east. Snow is the main form of precipitation from November through March, while rain is the most common the rest of the year. It has snowed in North Dakota during every month except July and August."

H1,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,Seasons
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"Winter in North Dakota is characterized by cold (below freezing) temperatures and snowfall. Snow is the main form of winter precipitation, but freezing rain, ice, sleet, and sometimes even rain are all possible during the winter months. Common storm systems include Alberta clippers or Panhandle hooks, some of which evolve into blizzards. Annual snowfall averages from 26 inches (66 cm) in the central part of the state to 38 inches (96.5 cm) in the northeast and southwest. Temperatures as low as −60 °F (−51 °C) have occurred during North Dakota winters."
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"Spring is a time of major transition in North Dakota. Early spring commonly sees snowstorms, but by late spring as temperatures begin to moderate the state can experience tornado outbreaks, a risk which diminishes but does not cease through the summer and into the fall as North Dakota lies at the northern edge of Tornado Alley. Springtime flooding is a relatively common event in the Red River Valley, due to the river flowing north into Canada. The spring melt and the eventual runoff typically begins earlier in the southern part of the valley than in the northern part. The most destructive flooding in eastern North Dakota occurred in 1997, which caused extensive damage to Grand Forks."
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"Summer sees heat and humidity predominate in the east, while hotter and less humid conditions are generally present in the west. These humid conditions help kick off thunderstorm activity 22–34 days a year. Summer high temperatures in North Dakota average in the mid 80s (30 °C) in the west to the upper 70s (25 °C) in the east, with temperatures as hot as 121 °F (49 °C) possible. The growing season in North Dakota usually begins in April, and harvest begins in September and October. Tornadoes are possible in North Dakota from April through October, but the peak tornado month is July, followed by June and August. The state averages 13 tornadoes per year. Depending on location, average annual precipitation ranges from 14 in (35.6 cm) to 22 in (55.9 cm)."
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"Autumn weather in North Dakota is largely the reverse of spring weather. The jet stream, which tends to weaken in summer, begins to re-strengthen, leading to a quicker changing of weather patterns and an increased variability of temperatures. By late October and November these storm systems become strong enough to form major winter storms. Fall and spring are the windiest times of the year in North Dakota."
H1,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,2017 drought
PA,12872944-Climate-of-North-Dakota,"As of September 2017, the United States Drought Monitor recorded abnormally dryweather conditions across the entire state. The drought is considered severe and unprecedented, and because of its nature as a ""unpredictable, sudden event brought on by sustained high temperatures and little rain"", it is considered a “flash drought”. North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced that predicted economic losses as a consequence from the drought could amount to as much as $4 billion or $5 billion."

After suffering an air attack off Morotai 30 May, she sighted heavy smoke and proceeded to investigate. The smoke was a lure that concealed a Japanese patrol boat. After evading this one, ""Haddo"" encountered six more of the smoking lures. ""Haddo"" sank two small craft 11 June and scouted the Tawi Tawi anchorage on 14 June. Shortly thereafter she was detected by a patrol airplane and pursued for almost 10 days. Her sixth war patrol was terminated 16 July at Fremantle."

Japanese convoys ventured into the Palawan area with strong air cover during the day, but usually anchored with escort protection for the night."
PA,1083640-USS-Haddo--SS-255,"Learning from that a convoy had been attacked by 4 days before and trailed to Paluan Bay, the submarines closed for the attack. As the convoy headed out to sea before daylight 21 August, ""Ray"" sank one transport while the escort vessels pursued ""Harder"". At this point ""Haddo"" entered the fray, launched six torpedoes at three targets, and dived to avoid air attack. Over one hundred depth charges churned the sea, but ""Haddo"" had already sunk cargo ships ""Kinryu Maru"" and ""Norfolk Maru""."

She launched a four-torpedo spread ""down the throat"" of the destroyer, which veered off and headed for Manila."
PA,1083640-USS-Haddo--SS-255,"Cruising off Cape Bolinao 23 August, the submarine was about to torpedo a tanker close to shore when she detected a pursuing destroyer. With four torpedoes she ripped off the warship's bow. ""Haddo"" then maneuvered to finish off her antagonist, but her last torpedo missed. Despite the efforts of two Japanese trawlers and another destroyer, ""Asakaze"" soon sank, giving ""Haddo"" another kill."
PA,1083640-USS-Haddo--SS-255,"Diverting to New Guinea to refuel and rearm, ""Haddo"" continued her seventh war patrol. She sank a sampan 8 September and 21 September found a convoy and maneuvered into position ahead of it. While turning to avoid a destroyer, ""Haddo"" lost depth control, and was not able to regain it in time to effectively attack the cargo ships. She subsequently headed for Subic Bay, and lifeguard duty, but on the way detected a hospital ship and survey ship in company. Disregarding the former, she sent the survey ship, ""Katsuriki"", to the bottom."
PA,1083640-USS-Haddo--SS-255,"After serving on lifeguard station and rescuing a Navy pilot from the sea 22 September, ""Haddo"" returned to Fremantle 3 October 1944. For this outstanding patrol the submarine received the Navy Unit Commendation."

Departing Fremantle 20 October she sank oiler ""Hishi Maru No. 2"" on 9 November, Serving as lifeguard boat for aircraft, she was credited with sinking ""No.3 Kyoei Maru"" on 6 December 1944, (but postwar accounting showed the target was only damaged) before terminating her eighth war patrol at Pearl Harbor 27 December. From there she was sent to Mare Island shipyard for much-needed repairs, arriving 5 January 1945."
PA,1083640-USS-Haddo--SS-255,"""Haddo"" departed on her ninth war patrol 16 May 1945. Cruising the East China and Yellow Seas, she attacked a convoy emerging from the fog 1 July and quickly sank a small coastal defense vessel and cargo ship, ""Taiun Maru No. 1"". Clearing the area, she heard automatic gunfire, and soon saw a frigate bearing down hard upon her. ""Haddo""'s skipper decided not to dive and instead turned on a parallel but opposite course, and the frigate shot by with her guns blazing. ""Haddo"" suffered little damage, and was able to avoid a companion escort and finally reach deep water. That evening she sank two sailing junks and then set course for a new station off Port Arthur. She sank a trawler 3 July, survived a furious depth charge attack by patrol vessels, and proceeded to Guam arriving 16 July 1945."

PA,13179749-Jay-Maisel,"One of Maisel's most notable images is his photograph of Miles Davis that appears on the cover of Davis's album ""Kind of Blue"" (1959). In 2009, Andy Baio created an image based on the original ""Kind of Blue"" album cover for the cover of a chiptune tribute album titled ""Kind of Bloop"". Attorneys representing Maisel demanded damages and that the resulting image is removed from the chiptune album, resulting in an out-of-court settlement of $32,500 from Baio."
PA,13179749-Jay-Maisel,"For almost 50 years Maisel lived with his family in the historic Germania Bank Building in lower Manhattan. Built in 1898, the single-family mansion contains 72 rooms over six floors. Maisel purchased the building in 1966 for $102,000 when the neighborhood was in severe decline. The building's value was estimated at $30 to $50 million in 2008. ""New York Magazine"" called it ""maybe the greatest real-estate coup of all time"". In February 2015, the building was sold for $55 million to developer Aby Rosen. Maisel's new residence, a nearly 27-foot-wide townhouse at 177 Pacific Street in a Brooklyn historic district, is three stories high with a full, finished basement; it has six bedrooms, six full baths and two half-baths and an elevator, over about 10,000 square feet of space.

PA,161176-Webcomic,"Webcomics (also known as online comics or Internet comics) are comics published on a website or mobile app. While many are published exclusively on the web, others are also published in magazines, newspapers or in comic books."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Webcomics can be compared to self-published print comics in that anyone with an Internet connection can publish their own webcomic. Readership levels vary widely; many are read only by the creator's immediate friends and family, while some of the largest claim audiences well over one million readers. Webcomics range from traditional comic strips and graphic novels to avant garde comics, and cover many genres, styles and subjects. They sometimes take on the role of a comic blog. The term web cartoonist is sometimes used to refer to someone who creates webcomics."
H1,161176-Webcomic,Medium
PA,161176-Webcomic,"There are several differences between webcomics and print comics. With webcomics the restrictions of the traditional newspapers or magazines can be lifted, allowing artists and writers to take advantage of the web's unique capabilities."
H1,161176-Webcomic,Styles
PA,161176-Webcomic,"The freedom webcomics provide allows artists to work in nontraditional styles. Clip art or photo comics (also known as fumetti) are two types of webcomics that do not use traditional artwork. ""A Softer World"", for example, is made by overlaying photographs with strips of typewriter-style text. As in the constrained comics tradition, a few webcomics, such as ""Dinosaur Comics"" by Ryan North, are created with most strips having art copied exactly from one (or a handful of) template comics and only the text changing. Pixel art, such as that created by Richard Stevens of ""Diesel Sweeties"", is similar to that of sprite comics but instead uses low-resolution images created by the artist himself. However, it is also common for artists to use traditional styles and layouts, similar to those published in newspapers or comic books."
H1,161176-Webcomic,Content
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Webcomics that are independently published are not subject to the content restrictions of book publishers or newspaper syndicates, enjoying an artistic freedom similar to underground and alternative comics. Some webcomics stretch the boundaries of taste, taking advantage of the fact that internet censorship is virtually nonexistent in countries like the United States. The content of webcomics can still cause problems, such as ""Leisure Town"" artist Tristan Farnon's legal trouble after creating a homoerotic ""Dilbert"" parody, or the Catholic League's protest of artist Eric Millikin's ""blasphemous treatment of Jesus."""
H1,161176-Webcomic,Format
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Webcomics come in a large variation of formats throughout the world. Comic strips, generally consisting of three or four panels, have traditionally been a popular format for webcomics. Other webcomics may mimic the pages of traditional comic books and graphic novels, sometimes in the hopes of eventually being published in print."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Scott McCloud, one of the first advocates of webcomics, pioneered the idea of the ""infinite canvas"" where, rather than being confined to normal print dimensions, artists are free to spread out in any direction indefinitely with their comics. Such a format proved highly successful in South-Korean webcomics when JunKoo Kim implemented an infinite scrolling mechanism in Line Webtoon in 2004. In 2009, French web cartoonist Balak described Turbomedia, a format for webcomics where a reader only views one panel at a time, in which the reader decides their own reading rhythm by going forward one panel at a time. Some web cartoonists, such as political cartoonist Mark Fiore or Charley Parker with ""Argon Zark!"", incorporate animations or interactive elements into their webcomics. There are also attempts to combine comic books presentation with live-action video sequences by Scottish company Rextale."
H1,161176-Webcomic,History
PA,161176-Webcomic,"The first comics to be shared through the Internet were created in the mid-1980s. Services such as CompuServe and Usenet were used before the World Wide Web started to rise in popularity in 1993. Early webcomics were usually derivatives from strips in college newspapers, but when the Web became widely popular in the mid-1990s, more people started creating comics exclusively for this medium. By the year 2000, various webcomic creators were financially successful and webcomics became more artistically recognized. Unique genres and styles became popular during this period."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"In the second half of the 2000s, webcomics became less financially sustainable due to the rise of social media and consumers' disinterest in certain kinds of merchandise. However, crowdsourcing through Kickstarter and Patreon also became popular in this period, allowing readers to donate money to webcomic creators directly. The 2010s also saw the rise of webtoons in South Korea, where the form has become very prominent. This decade has also seen an increasingly larger number of successful webcomics being adapted into animated series in China and Japan."

PA,161176-Webcomic,"While comic strip syndicates had been present online since the mid-1990s, traditional comic book publishers, such as Marvel Comics and Slave Labour Graphics, did not begin making serious digital efforts until 2006 and 2007. DC Comics launched its web comic imprint, Zuda Comics in October 2007. The site featured user submitted comics in a competition for a professional contract to produce web comics. In July 2010, it was announced that DC was closing down Zuda."
H1,161176-Webcomic,Business
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Creators of webcomics are able to do so professionally through various revenue channels. Webcomic artists may sell merchandise based on their work, such as T-shirts and toys, or they may sell print versions or compilations of their webcomic. Many webcomic creators make use of online advertisement on their websites, and some have undergone product placement deals with larger companies. Crowdfunding through Kickstarter and Patreon have also become sources of income for web cartoonists."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Webcomics have been used by some cartoonists as a path towards syndication in newspapers; however, out of the thousands of comics submitted to each syndicate every year, only a few are accepted. In 2000, Scott McCloud predicted that micropayments would become a major source of income for web cartoonists, but this declaration never came to fruition."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Many webcomic artists started creating their online works without an intention to directly profit from it, often instead publishing through the Internet in order to get (instant) feedback on their skills. Other artists start creating a webcomic with the intention of becoming a professional; many don't succeed in part because they ""put the business before the art."" Meanwhile, many successful webcomic artists are diversifying their income streams in order to not be solely dependent on the webcomic itself."
H1,161176-Webcomic,Awards
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Many webcomics artists have received honors for their work. In 2006, Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel ""American Born Chinese"", originally published as a webcomic on Modern Tales, was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award. Don Hertzfeldt's animated film based on his webcomics, ""Everything Will Be OK"", won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, a prize rarely bestowed on an animated film."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Many traditionally print-comics focused organizations have added award categories for comics published on the web. The Eagle Awards established a Favorite Web-based Comic category in 2000, and the Ignatz Awards followed the next year by introducing an Outstanding Online Comic category in 2001. After having nominated webcomics in several of their traditional print-comics categories, the Eisner Awards began awarding comics in the Best Digital Comic category in 2005. In 2006 the Harvey Awards established a Best Online Comics Work category, and in 2007 the Shuster Awards began an Outstanding Canadian Web Comic Creator Award. In 2012 the National Cartoonists Society gave their first Reuben Award for ""On-line comic strips."""
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Other awards focus exclusively on webcomics. The Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards consist of a number of awards that were handed out annually from 2001 to 2008. The Clickburg Webcomic Awards (also known as ""the Clickies"") has been handed out annually since 2005 at the Stripdagen Haarlem comic festival. The awards require the recipient to be active in the Benelux countries, with the exception of one international award."
LI,161176-Webcomic,Webcomics in print
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Though webcomics are typically published primarily on the World Wide Web, some web cartoonists may get publishing deals in which comic books are created of their work. Sometimes, these books are published by mainstream comics publishers who are traditionally aimed at the direct market of regional comic books. Some web cartoonists may pursue print syndication in established newspapers or magazines. In other cases, webcomic creators decide to self-publish their work. Crowdfunding through Kickstarter is often used in order to fund such projects."
PA,161176-Webcomic,"The traditional audience base for webcomics and print comics are vastly different, and webcomic readers do not necessarily go to bookstores. For some web cartoonists, a print release may be considered the ""goal"" of a webcomic series, while for others, comic books are ""just another way to get the content out."" Webcomics have been seen by some artists as a potential new path towards syndication in newspapers, but attempts have rarely proven lucrative. According to Jeph Jacques (""Questionable Content""), ""there's no real money"" in syndication for webcomic artists. Some artist would not be able to syndicate their work in newspaper because they fill up a specific niche and wouldn't be accepted by a broader audience."
LI,161176-Webcomic,Non-anglophone webcomics
PA,161176-Webcomic,"Many webcomics are published primarily in English, this being a major language in Australia, Canada, India, the United States, and various European countries. Cultures surrounding non-anglophone webcomics have thrived in countries such as China, France, India, Japan and South Korea."
PA,161176-Webcomic,Webcomics have been a popular medium in India since the early 2000s. Indian webcomics are successful as they reach a large audience for free and they are frequently used by the country's younger generation to spread social awareness on topics such as politics and feminism. These webcomics reach a large amount of exposure by being spread through social media.
PA,161176-Webcomic,"In China, Chinese webcomics have become a popular way to criticize the communist government and poiticians in the country. Many webcomics by popular artists get shared around the country thanks to social networks such as Sina Weibo and WeChat. Many titles will often be censored or taken down by the government."

PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"The Outeniqua Mountains, named after the Outeniqua Khoikhoi who lived there, is a mountain range that runs a parallel to the southern coast of South Africa, and forms a continuous range with the Langeberg to the west and the Tsitsikamma Mountains to the east. It was known as ""Serra de Estrella"" (""Mountain of the Star"") to the Portuguese. The mountains are part of the Garden Route of South Africa."
H1,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,Nomenclature
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"""Outeniqua"" is said to be derived from a Khoikhoi tribe that once lived in the mountains, and means ""they who bear honey"". Rock paintings by those people can still be found in the area."
H1,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,Geography
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"The range is characterized by gentle southern slopes and steep drops on the north side down to the low valley Little Karoo. High points include Cradock Peak at 1578 m and George Peak at 1370 m located to the north of George. The varying conditions create diverse habitats. On the south-facing slopes there is montane fynbos at higher, moister altitudes, while the north hosts karroid and renosterveld shrubland. On the mesic southern slopes there are Afromontane gallery forests."
H1,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,Weather
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"The high rainfall on the range has created numerous perennial streams used for irrigation in the Olifants River valley. While the climate along the range is generally hot to moderate, with an average summer temperature of 20.5 °C, weather conditions can vary greatly. In winter the temperature can drop to 5 °C (and even lower on the southern slopes) and snowfalls may occur on the higher peaks."
H1,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,Fauna and flora
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"Among the animals found in the Outeniqua range are klipspringer, grey rhebuck, leopard and various rodents. The Outeniqua mountain range is also home to a very small number of African elephants. Although described as functionally extinct, new sightings of these very elusive animals, including that of a young bull give hope that the fabled animals might with time become re-established in the Outeniqua reserve. Birds include black eagles and other raptors as well as the Cape sugarbird and other fynbos birds."

PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"In 1908, work started on a railway route over the range from George to Oudtshoorn. This required the building of seven tunnels and numerous long cuttings. The line was opened in August 1913."
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"The first road pass to cross the range into the Langkloof went via Duiwelskop, some 32 km east of George."
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"In 1816, Cradock Pass, named after the Governor, Sir John Cradock, finished construction, and became known as the ""Voortrekker Road"". It had a difficult reputation. As early as 1831, Magistrate George van der Riet had inspected the road and found it to be a ""complete bar"" for all trade activities, and it had been characterised over time variously as ""the most formidably bad, if not of all roads I ever saw"", a ""stupendous mountain"" and ""dangerous and very bad""."
PA,17770218-Outeniqua-Mountains,"In 1847, a vastly improved Montagu Pass was constructed by convict labour, and named after the Colonial Secretary, John Montagu. In 1943, to cope with the increasing demands of modern traffic, construction was started on the Outeniqua Pass, using the labour of Italian prisoners of war. At the end of World War II the Italians returned home with the greater part of the pass unfinished. The pass was opened to traffic in September 1951, having cost approximately £500 000."

This sector is composed of 400 firms and 35,700 employees and contributes to .45 percent to GDP, accounting for 16% of the industry's output."
PA,12092450-General-Pacheco,"The Ford Falcon plant was produced in Argentina in 1965 in the city of General Pacheco. Ford produced the Ford Falcon From 1961 to 1991. Once this plant was established in Argentina and got up and running, through modifications in indigenous institutional arrangements, Argentina soon became the thirteenth largest exporter of automobiles nationwide. These big industries have direct impacts on the population that usually go unrecognized. This population that goes unrecognized is also the population that does most of the work for the industry. Ford hired a workforce in which 90% had a high school education and only one third had a university degree. Plants like this rely on young and educated workers with often little industrial experience. Workers come into the motor industry at around the age of 23, after working in the agriculture industry prior to the motor industry. When establishing a huge industry, policies with the intent of progression for the assembly sector matter more than the social structure of the country, let alone the population of one city. A combination of school and training became central to the plant's operation in order to continue to manufacture cars."

In 2009, there was a major H1N1 influenza pandemic outbreak, which started in Mexico late March and made its way to Argentina that same year. This outbreak had a direct effect on the workers of the company. 150 workers were laid off, making it the most prominent labor-management conflict in Argentina in 2009. This led to a picket on the Pan American Highway. The workers asked for a raise in salary of 70% and requested a one-month paid leave in quest of avoiding the flu. Both of these requests were rejected by the company. Management wanted to prevent the workers from benefiting from future collective bargains. 40 workers experienced violent eviction by the police force."
PA,12092450-General-Pacheco,"Thousands of wage-workers face the possibility of unemployment and threatened livelihoods due to dominating employment relations. Therefore, workers get together and create a social movement in hopes of obtaining a progressive collective action. The goal is to build new social values, new organization forms and new modes of mobilization among food factories. However, this may be difficult due to limits imposed by the markets dynamics and realm of production. In most cases, this leads to self-management allowing for the distribution of tasks within the collective of workers and equal distribution of income. This opportunity for personal development is unseen among a company where the workers do not take initiative. In most cases, the workers are forced to simply compromise and their needs and interests go unrecognized. Social organization is of essence when determining the outcome and success of an industry."

PA,1689397-Pusser-s,"Pusser's Rum is a brand name of rum produced by Pusser's Rum Ltd. Nine years after the Royal Navy discontinued the daily rum ration in 1970, the company was founded to produce the rum from the original Royal Navy recipe, using a blend of five West Indian rums."
H1,1689397-Pusser-s,History
PA,1689397-Pusser-s,"""Pusser"" is Royal Navy slang for a purser, a ship's supply officer, now called a Logistics Officer. Thus the word came to connote ""one hundred per cent Service,"" as in ""pusser's issue."" ""Pusser's issue"" applies to anything supplied by the Royal Navy, such as a ""pusser's grip"", a canvas bag that sailors may use instead of a suitcase (it folds flat and is thus easy to stow on board ship)."
PA,1689397-Pusser-s,"The Royal Navy issued the last tot (ration) to ""the fleet"" on 31 July 1970. Since then, this has been known in Royal Naval Slang as ""Black Tot Day."" The remaining rum stocks were put up for auction. They were bought by Brian Cornford, shipped to Gibraltar and held in a secure bonded warehouse. As each visiting Royal Navy ship visited Gibraltar, it was the task of Cornford and his General Manager, John Kania, to supply individual, wax-dated, corked, wicker-covered demijohns containing full strength (approx 110 proof) to the ships. When the individual gallon jars were finally sold, the large wooden barrels were tapped. It was found that over the years some of the contents in each wood barrel had evaporated, and diluted the strength to a slight degree, though some would say it simply mellowed. The barrelled rum was decanted into litre bottles and sold primarily to RN, RAF and Army messes and selected local pubs."
PA,1689397-Pusser-s,"In 1979, nearly a decade after the Royal Navy abandoned the custom of the daily tot of rum, company founder Charles Tobias obtained the rights to blending information associated with the naval rum ration and formed the company to produce the spirit according to the original Admiralty recipe, a blend of five West Indian rums without colouring agents."
PA,1689397-Pusser-s,"Some Genuine Royal Navy Rum still pops up in premium auction houses, and apart from the collectability aspect, the contents are vintage, and because of the wax seal is still as powerful as the day it was bottled. It is rarely seen, though bought at auction (the last time for £1250) for special ceremonial events. This is not to be confused with the commercially bottled Pusser's Rum seen on supermarket shelves dated after 1970."
H1,1689397-Pusser-s,Philanthropy
PA,1689397-Pusser-s,"As part of the agreement with the Admiralty granting Tobias the right to produce Pusser's Rum to the original specification, the Royal Navy Sailors’ Fund, a naval charity more commonly called the ‘Tot’ Fund, receives a substantial donation from the worldwide sales of the rum on an ongoing basis."

LI,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,The Terminal Man
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"The Terminal Man is a novel by American writer Michael Crichton, about the dangers of mind control. It was published in April 1972, and also serialized in ""Playboy"" in March, April, and May 1972. In 1974, it was made into a film of the same name."
H1,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,Plot summary
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"The events in the novel take place between March 9 and March 13, 1971. Harold Franklin ""Harry"" Benson, a computer scientist (specializing in artificial intelligence) in his middle thirties, is described as suffering from psychomotor epilepsy following a car crash he had endured in 1969. He often has seizures followed by blackouts, and then wakes up hours later with no knowledge of what he has done. During his seizures, he severely beats two people; the day before his admission, he had been arrested after attacking a third, a gas-station attendant. He is a prime candidate for an operation to implant electrodes in the amygdala region of his brain in order to control the seizures, which will be performed in the Neuro-Psychiatric Service of University Hospital. Two NPS surgeons, John Ellis and Robert Morris, are to perform the surgery, which is unprecedented for the time. In modern medicine, such a device would be called a neurostimulator; in the book, it is referred to as a 'brain pacemaker'."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"The ramifications of the procedure are questioned by the NPS's staff psychiatrist, Janet Ross, and later by her former teacher, an emeritus professor named Manon, at the lecture about the surgery. Manon raises concerns that Benson is psychotic (pointing to Benson's belief that machines are in hostile competition against humans and that machines will ultimately take over the world) and notes that the crimes he commits during the blackouts will not be curtailed. Ellis admits that what they are doing is not a cure, simply a way to stimulate the brain when the computer senses a seizure coming on. It would prevent a seizure but not cure his personality disorder. Ellis rationalizes his approach by pointing out that he is not convinced that not operating on Benson will do him any favors; Benson's condition threatens his life and those of others, has already undermined his legal status three times, and is worsening. Despite the concerns voiced, the team decides to go ahead with the operation."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"The operation implants forty electrodes in Benson's brain, controlled by a small computer that is powered by a plutonium power pack in his shoulder. Benson must wear a dogtag that says to call University Hospital if he is injured, as his atomic power pack may emit radiation. While he is recovering, a woman identifying herself by the name of Angela Black gives Morris a blonde wig for Benson, whose head was shaved prior to the operation."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"Morris goes back to his normal work, where he interviews a man who volunteers to have electrodes put into his mind to stimulate pleasure. Morris refuses him, but realizes that people like Benson could potentially become addicts. He recalls a Norwegian man with schizophrenia, who was allowed to stimulate himself as much as he wanted, and did so much that it actually gave him brain damage."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"Roger A. McPherson, head of the Neuro-Psychiatric Service, interviews Benson, who is still convinced that machines are conspiring to take over the world. McPherson realizes Manon and Ross were right and orders nurses to administer Thorazine to Benson."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"After resting for a day, Benson goes through ""interfacing."" The forty electrodes in his brain are activated by computer technicians Gerhard and Richards, one by one, to see which ones would stop a seizure. Each produces different results. One of the electrodes stimulates a sexual pleasure. Ross asks Gerhard to monitor Benson every ten minutes."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"Gerhard shows his findings to Ross, who realizes that the seizures are getting more frequent. She explains that Benson is learning to initiate seizures involuntarily because the result of these seizures is a shock of pleasure, which leads to him having more frequent seizures. Ross checks on Benson, and discovers that, due to the clerical error of the nurses not having been able to read McPherson's signature, Benson has not been receiving his Thorazine. She then finds out that Benson, using the black wig and disguising himself as an orderly, has evaded the police officer assigned to guard him and escaped from the hospital."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"Ross goes to Benson's house, but instead finds two girls who say he has a gun and blueprints for the basement of University Hospital, where the computer mainframe is located. Ellis searches at a strip club where Benson, who is fascinated with all things sexual, spends a lot of time, but fails to find him. Morris goes to the firm where Benson is employed, and there meets Benson's boss who tells him that Benson disliked University Hospital because of its ultra-modern computer system, an upgraded IBM System/360 which the hospital had obtained during ""Watershed Week,"" a week in July 1969 during which the total information-handling capacity of all the world's computers exceeded that of all the world's human brains."
PA,1234167-The-Terminal-Man,"Ross is contacted by Los Angeles Police Captain of Detectives John Anders, a homicide detective who had found Benson's dogtag at the murder scene of Angela Black. (She proves to have been a dancer with the real name of Doris Blankfurt.) After answering questions at the police station, Ross goes home. Benson arrives at her house, and has a seizure, which causes him to attack Ross. Just before losing consciousness herself, Ross manages to turn on her microwave oven.

Perpetrators also raped women, burned down 43 houses, stole cattle and forcibly displaced 900 people."

H1,17082968-El-Aro-Massacre,Controversy
PA,17082968-El-Aro-Massacre,"On April 23, 2008, Colombian President, Álvaro Uribe publicly announced that a former paramilitary fighter, Francisco Enrique Villalba Hernández, had accused him of planning the massacre, along with General Ospina, General Rosso and paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso, among other individuals. Uribe had been Governor of Antioquia between 1995 and 1997. According to Uribe, Villalba had said that he (Uribe) had thanked the perpetrators of the massacre for freeing 6 hostages, allegedly including one of his cousins, that Uribe's brother had provided 20 paramilitary members for the crime, and that they had met in the town of La Caucana to plan the massacre."
PA,17082968-El-Aro-Massacre,"Uribe answered that he had never been to La Caucana and that these declarations showed inconsistencies because they mentioned the participation of a General in the supposed meeting who had died months prior to the events. Uribe also said that since 1988, Colombian authorities would know ""where I've been, where I have slept and with whom I have met"". The Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana reported that the paramilitary in question, Francisco Enrique Villalba Hernández, had not mentioned Uribe nor the rescue of any hostages during previous declarations made more than five years ago, when he was sentenced for his own role in the massacre. The magazine also listed a number of possible inconsistencies in his most recent testimony, including the alleged presence of General Manosalva, who had died months before the date of the meeting where the massacre was planned."
PA,17082968-El-Aro-Massacre,"Opposition Senator Gustavo Petro had questioned Uribe about the use of a Department of Antioquia government owned helicopter that was allegedly employed to transport the paramilitaries to the region of El Aro to perpetrate the massacre. During a press conference, Uribe denied these claims saying that all the helicopters had a recorded flight history. He was also questioned a beeper message intercepted to one of the paramilitaries involved in the massacre that said """"Te recuerdo llamar al Gobernador. Preséntame y que yo lo visito en la tarde"""" (I remind you to call the governor. Introduce me and I will visit him in the afternoon). Uribe defended himself from these claims saying that the criminals could have used the term ""governor"" as slang to refer to anything and denied having met any of the perpetrators of the massacre."
PA,17082968-El-Aro-Massacre,Imprisoned paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso said that the victims of the massacre had died in combat and were not civilians but guerrillas. Mancuso was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison for the massacre.
PA,17082968-El-Aro-Massacre,"After his extradition to the United States, Mancuso has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, Revista Semana reported on Mancuso's declarations about the 1997 El Aro massacre, in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the Colombian military and police. Mancuso said that three helicopters, one belonging to the guerrillas, another from the Colombian military and one from the Antioquia governor's office were present in the zone during the events."

H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Summary
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"The Tamír Triad is a fantasy trilogy by American writer Lynn Flewelling. It contains three novels, and has a sister series, ""The Nightrunner Series"", which contains seven. The series contains mythopoeia. The resounding issue dealt with within the series is the on-and-off war between two fictional countries, Skala and Plenimar, and their citizens, with other countries and people often getting caught in the crossfire."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"The series focuses on Queen Tamír II, known throughout her childhood as Prince Tobin, and how she goes from being a sad, haunted child, to a Warrior Queen. Dark magic was used to disguise her in childhood from her Uncle, who would have all the women in his line killed in case they tried to take his throne, but the Oracle predicts that Tamír will be Queen, and many people go through unbelievable lengths to make sure that it happens."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"It has been translated into multiple languages and published in multiple countries, including Russia. Bantam Spectra is the publishing company of all three, as well as the sister series, ""The Nightrunner Series""."
H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Synopsis
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"The story is set in the land of Skala - a world with knights, lords, ladies and wizards. Long ago, the Lightbearer pronounced a prophecy; so long as a daughter of the royal line defends and rules, Skala will never be subjugated. Under the reign of Warrior Queens, Skala was free of famine and disease for a time. However, Skala is now ruled by King Erius - a usurper king who took the throne in the place of his younger sister. King Erius' rule brought famine, plague, and invasion - and his fear of a child with a stronger claim to the throne led him to order the deaths of all girls of the royal line, save his sister."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"The story begins when a wizard and her apprentice learn of a child born of Ariani, the King's sister. This child is destined to overthrow her Uncle and become Queen of Skala, but in order to do this she will need protection and guidance. And if King Erius learns of her birth, she will be killed immediately."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"Quickly, the Wizards rush to find a way to disguise their future Queen. Ariani gives birth to twins - a boy and a girl. In order to save the girl, they kill the boy-child and use hill-witch magic to transform the girl's body into that of a boy. The wizards tell the king that the girl-child, and not the boy, died in childbirth."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"Saved by this lie, the child (named Tobin) grows up knowing nothing of her true identity as a girl and a future Queen, nor of the murder that was committed to save her. Tobin (thinking herself a boy) has a lonely childhood, hidden away from Court and all other children in order to keep him from danger. He grows up with a mother driven mad from the grief of losing a child, and a father who is rarely home because of the war that plagues their country. Often, his only companion is the angry and vengeful ghost of his dead brother, who haunts him constantly."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,But things start to change when the wizards bring him a companion - Ki. And eventually Tobin must travel to Court and take his place among the Companions of Prince Korin.
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"Tobin must resist powerful magic, learn to survive at Court, and become a knight and blooded warrior. He struggles with the issue of his identity. And one day he must challenge his friend and cousin for the throne, and fulfill a powerful prophecy."
H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Characters
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"Tamír í Ariani Gherilain, also known as Queen Tamír II, and previously known as Prince Tobin, was introduced in the first book, ""The Bone Doll's Twin"". She is the main character in every following book of the trilogy."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"The main character of the 'Tamir Triad', Queen Tamir II was initially introduced as Prince Tobin. She was disguised as a boy so as to easily hide from her Uncle, who would have her killed as a threat to his place on the throne, which was rightfully her mother's. Eventually, she must reveal herself as female, and fight her cousin in Civil War, in order to take her place on the throne and repair the country her Uncle had tarnished in his rejection of the Oracle's declaration that there must be a Queen of Skala. She is mentioned in the 'Nightrunner Series' as one of the greatest Skalan Queens, being responsible for the Great Canal, the new capital of Rhiminee', and the Third Oreska."
H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Countries and cultures
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"One defining feature of Skala is that the throne is always held by a Queen, power traveling matrilineally. The queen takes an active role in the defense of Skala, riding out and taking part in battles, and holds the military title of ""War Commander."" She is also in charge of helping her people in times of peace, by acting as the judge for public disputes, as well as controlling taxes, food availability, plague and more. This is due to the prophecy made at the Afran Oracle in Skala, which states:"
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"This prophecy was made during The Great War with Plenimar, and King Thelatimos instantly handed the crown to his daughter Gherilain, who quickly led the country to victory. Other than the Queen, there are many important roles within the Skalan government, such as Commanders, Generals, Secretaries, Treasures, etc. Many nobles own their own land and armies, though swear fealty to the Queen and give her their forces in times of war."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"Following Queen Gherilain the First, there have been many Queens, and occasionally, Kings. Those known are Tamir, who was poisoned by her own brother, Pelis, who became King until plague struck him down and his niece, Agnalain, became Queen. Then was Gherilain II followed by Iaair, who was known to have fought a dragon, Klia, who killed a lion, Klie, Markira, Oslie, who had six fingers, and Marnil, who began the tradition of having more than one consort. Having a male King is not completely ruled out, but still it is very much the exception - a Queen is considered the obviously preferable option (the opposite of how things were in historical feudal monarchies); having a King instead of a Queen involves the risk of pestilence, drought and/or foreign invasion - all attributed to the Illior's curse. In the generation preceding that of Tamir II, Queen Agnalain III was the first mad Queen and Erius, her son, became King because his sister was still just a child at the time of their mother's death - but Tamir II, his niece, became Queen instead of his son when he died."
H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Moral issues
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"At the center of the Tamír Triad is the moral issue of whether the end justifies the means. This is put very starkly at the very beginning. In order to save the future of Skala, the True Queen, Tamír, must survive the murderous schemes of her usurper uncle and live to grow to maturity. But in order to provide the magical disguise which alone could preserve her life, the well-meaning protagonists must perpetrate a terrible act - to kill an innocent baby, the future Queen's twin brother, at the very moment of his drawing his first breath. Throughout the three volumes, all those involved in this act not only suffer pangs of conscience but are also quite literally haunted by the vengeful ghost of the murdered baby."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"In later stages of the plot, there are further cases where it is considered that the end justifies the means, and that anyone discovering the secret must be killed though they are completely innocent. There is a clear difference between the wizard Arkoniel - who tends to be more compassionate - and his teacher and mentor Iya, who while a positive character is more ready to take ruthless decisions. Arkoniel's approach is vindicated when he refrains from killing Ki, Korin/Tamir beloved friend, though Ki was on the point of discovering the secret. As later seen, the living Ki plays a major role in helping Tamir realize her destiny."
H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Transsexual issues
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"Transsexual issues have a central role in the Tamír Triad, as they virtually never were in earlier generations of Fantasy writing. To begin with, Prince Tobin is to all appearances a male - both in his own perception and in that of others. Boys who swim naked together with Tobin have no reason to doubt his male anatomy. Yet, due to the magical reasons which are an important part of the plot, in the underlying, essential identity Tobin had always been a disguised girl. In the cataclysmic scene of magical change this becomes an evident physical fact, and Prince Tobin becomes Queen Tamír, shedding the male body and gaining a fully functioning female one. Yet, it takes Tamír a considerable time and effort to come to terms with her female sexuality. She feels especially queasy at the prospect of eventually becoming pregnant - as she must, since producing an heir is an important part of a Queen's duty. There is also the problematic relationship with Ki, who had been the close boy companion of Prince Tobin and whose transformation into the Queen's lover or Consort is far from smooth or easy."
H1,19107036-Tamír-Triad,Further reading
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"The companion series, The Nightrunner Series, was also written by Lynn Flewelling and deals with the ongoing war between Skala and Plenimar from the perspective of two young spies, nearly 600 years after Tamír becomes Queen."
PA,19107036-Tamír-Triad,"In the ""afterward"" appearing at the conclusion of ""Shards of Time"", eighth and last book of The Nightrunner Series, Flewelling notes that she ""had not forgotten Tamír and Ki"", and might write more books about them. In Chapter 14 of ""Luck in the Shadows"", the character Sedrich tells of Tamír's life from the perspective of six hundred years after her time: ""Skala's had good queens and bad, but old Tamír was one of the best. Even the balladeers can't improve much on the life she led."" This is followed by a brief recapitulation of Tamír's life. After speaking of the events covered in the Tamír Triad, Sedrich goes on tell that ""during her reign she beat back the Plenimarans, was lost at sea during a battle, then turned up a year later and took back the throne and ruled until she was an old woman"". As of mid-2017, this later adventure was not written out in full."

Eadie returned late in the season and resumed the fullback role with Eden missing the Sea Eagles run to the Grand Final where they ultimately lost 21-8 to Parramatta. During the season, Eden was named the player of the series in the 1982 KB Cup won by Manly for the first time. Eden's form in 1982, plus his goal kicking and utility value saw his name touted as a possible selection for the 1982 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France.

Eden later said, ""Manly eventually told me they weren’t going to be able to go anywhere near what they were offering over at the Roosters, but that they’d still love me to stay. I just said, 'Look, you've offered me three grand, the Roosters have offered me 25 … I’m newly married and got a kid on the way … a university wage, help me out here.'

PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"Robert Allan ""Bashin' Bob"" Bailey (May 29, 1931 – October 24, 2003) was an ice hockey right winger. He spent time with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, and Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League. He was known for being involved with trades for over twenty players and was even traded for Bill Dineen on three separate occasions. He was inducted into the Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame on March 17, 1970 for his time with the Dayton Gems."
H1,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,Professional career
H1,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,Minor league hockey
PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"Bailey had his first taste of professional hockey at the age of 16 when he played 22 games with the Windsor Hettche Spitfires of the International Hockey League. He performed well, but many on the coaching staff felt he needed more time develop. He continued his play with the Stratford Kroehlers and didn't return to the IHL until the 1951–52 season, when he played in the final two games of the season for the Toledo Mercurys. However that was all it took. The Detroit Red Wings owned the rights to Bailey and decided to trade him to the Cleveland Barons along with his brother, John Bailey for the rights to Lou Jankowski and Bill Dineen in June 1951. In the American Hockey League Bailey flourished, playing in 54 games, amassing 46 points and a team-high 115 penalty minutes. That's all it took, as the Toronto Maple Leafs had had their eye on young Bailey and wanted to see what he could do. On May 30, 1953, Toronto traded Chuck Blair and 30,000 USD to Cleveland for Bailey and Gerry Foley."
H1,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,Reaching the NHL
PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"After spending a short amount of time in the Maple Leafs' farm system with the of the QHL and the Pittsburgh Hornets, Bailey made his debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the middle of the 1953–54 season. He played in 48 games and scored 9 points, but also joined the Leafs' short playoff run against the Detroit Red Wings. Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard had a short altercation with the young rookie when he butt-ended Bailey with his stick after Bailey slammed Richard into the boards. Throughout the game Richard repeatedly tried to renew his attack on Bailey and even refused to leave the ice after a slash when ordered by the referee. The following two seasons would be much less dramatic as they saw Bailey splitting time between the Maple Leafs and the Hornets, never really finding his scoring touch when brought up to the big leagues. While playing for the Hornets in 1956, Bailey was suspended from the remainder of the playoffs and fined 575 USD for assaulting referee Jerry Olinski on April 2."
PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"On May 28, 1956, Bailey was traded along with Bob Sabourin to the Springfield Indians for 11,000 USD. On September 22, 1956, Bailey was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for cash, but would remain in Springfield on loan. He played 40 games for the Indians before being called up to replace injured players for the Detroit Red Wings. He joined the Red Wings for their short playoff run against the Boston Bruins. The 1957–58 season saw Bailey playing for the Chicago Blackhawks after being acquired in an Inter-league draft on June 5, 1957. He would only play in 28 games before again being traded, this time with Jack McIntyre, Nick Mickoski and Hec Lalonde for Earl Reibel, Billy Dea, Lorne Ferguson and Bill Dineen on December 17, 1957. Bailey again joined Detroit for the playoffs and again had a post-season altercation. During the semi-finals against the Montreal Canadiens, there was a bench-clearing brawl that all started in the second period, precipitated by Bailey charging Montreal's goaltender, Jacques Plante. To settle the teams (and the crowd), referee Frank Udvari sent both teams to their dressing rooms and added the 5:22 remaining in that second period to the third stanza. The Canadiens ended up winning 2-1 and knocked Detroit out of the playoffs in four games. The 1957-58 season would be Bailey's last in the NHL."
PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"On July 31, 1958, Bailey was again traded to Cleveland from Detroit, this time for cash. However, Bailey picked up his scoring game for the 1958–59 season and finished third on the team in scoring and first again in penalty minutes. The following season saw Bailey playing only five more games for the Barons before being traded for Bill Dineen once again, this time to the Buffalo Bisons on October 20, 1959. He would finish out the season in Buffalo at almost a point-per-game pace. In 1960, Bailey was involved in another multiplayer trade on June 7. Bailey, Glen Skov, the rights to Danny Lewicki, Terry Gray and Lorne Ferguson went to the Montreal Canadiens for Cecil Hoekstra, Reggie Fleming, Ab McDonald and Bob Courcy. However, he wouldn't see ice time with Montreal as he would spend time with Montreal's minor leagues. Bailey spent the 1960–61 season with the Quebec Aces and the start of the 1961–62 season with the Pittsburgh Hornets before again being traded. This time Bailey would be switching leagues as Pittsburgh traded him to the San Francisco Seals of the Western Hockey League for Gord Redahl on February 27, 1962."
PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"On the Seals, Bailey failed to put up large numbers and was sent to the Philadelphia Ramblers of the Eastern Hockey League. He had his best offensive season to date with the Ramblers, scoring 26 goals for a total of 91 points during the 1962–63 season. He also helped head coach for a short time that season along with Hugh Currie and Doug Adam.

PA,10481657-Bob-Bailey--ice-hockey,"This turned out to be a great fit as Bailey put up his best numbers ever, scoring a career-high and team-leading 132 points in the 1965–66 season. In his final season, Bailey was suspended after slugging referee Billy Purcell in a game at Fort Wayne on December 9, 1967. This is what helped convince Bailey to retire in 1968.

PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,Death To The World is an Eastern Orthodox zine published in the United States.
H1,12986840-Death-to-the-World,History
PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,"""Death to the World"" was started by monks and nuns from the St Herman of Alaska Monastery in Platina, California, as a medium of evangelism to teens involved in the punk subculture by monastics who were ex-punks. A founding member was Justin Marler who, soon after recording ""Volume One"" with seminal doom metal band Sleep in 1991, left for seven years of monastic life while Sleep went on to become metal icons."
PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,"Originally, the monastics planned to submit an article about Fr. Seraphim Rose to the magazine ""Maximum RocknRoll"". They later decided to try to place an ad for their monastery, but were only rudely rejected, being told that the magazine ""only [ran] ads for music and zines"". This inspired them to begin a zine."
PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,"The first issue was printed in the December of ’94 featuring a monk holding a skull on cover. The hand-drawn bold letters across the top read “DEATH TO THE WORLD, The Last True Rebellion” and the back cover held the caption: “they hated me without a cause.” ... The first issue, decorated with ancient icons and lives of martyrs inside, was advertised in Maximum RocknRoll and brought letters from all around the world."
PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,"The 'zine continued to be published and distributed at punks shows and underground hangouts. It was estimated that at one time, there were 50,000 in circulation. The monastics put out 12 issues in all, after which they continued distributing the 'zine but didn't publish new issues."
PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,"Eight years later, the zine was revived by convert members of Saint Barnabas Antiochian Orthodox Church in Costa Mesa, California. New issues are submitted to the St Herman monks for editing and revision, and are released quarterly."
PA,12986840-Death-to-the-World,"The zine had a considerable impact on counter culture youth during the mid to late 90s, which caught the attention of mainstream press, and quickly led to the release of Justin Marler's first book in 1997, Youth of the Apocalypse, (co-authored with a fellow monastic)."

LI,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,Sergey Vasilyevich Marchuk (; 13 April 1952 – 25 August 2016) was a Russian speed skater.
H1,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,Biography
PA,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,"In 1977, Marchuk skated 3:56.65 on the 3,000 m on the fast Medeo rink of Alma-Ata, significantly below Ard Schenk's world record time of 4:08.3. Unfortunately for Marchuk, the tournament had not been approved by the International Skating Union (ISU) and so his time was not recognised as a world record. It would be 15 years before anyone, officially or unofficially, skated the 3,000 m faster than Marchuk had. This happened in 1992 when Thomas Bos skated an official world record of 3:56.16 at the indoor arena of Calgary – the Olympic Oval."
PA,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,"Marchuk had his best year in 1978 when he became Soviet Allround Champion, European Allround Champion, and won bronze at the World Allround Championships."

PA,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,"To put these personal records in perspective, the ""WR"" column lists the official world records on the dates that Marchuk skated his personal records."
PA,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,"Note that Marchuk's personal record on the 1,000 m was not recognised as a world record by the ISU because he skated it at a non-approved meet. In addition, Eric Heiden skated even faster (1:14.47) at that same meet. Marchuk's personal record on the 3,000 m was set during that same non-approved meet, so it was not recognised as a world record either. Finally, Marchuk's personal record on the ""big combination"" was not a world record either because Jan Egil Storholt skated 163.221 at that same meet."
PA,13297588-Sergey-Marchuk,Marchuk has an Adelskalender score of 162.996 points. He was number one on the Adelskalender for 350 days in 1977 and 1978.

H2,133176-Surfactant,Surfactant
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Etymology and definition
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The word ""surfactant"" is a blend of ""surface-active agent""."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The United States National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabulary reserves ""surfactant"" for the meaning ""pulmonary surfactant"". For the more general meaning, ""surface active agent/s"" is the heading."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Composition and structure
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Surfactants are usually organic compounds that are amphiphilic, meaning they contain both hydrophobic groups (their ""tails"") and hydrophilic groups (their ""heads""). Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and adsorb at interfaces between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are soaps. Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (1700 kton/y), lignin sulfonates (600 kton/y), fatty alcohol ethoxylates (700 ktons/y), and alkylphenol ethoxylates (500 kton/y)."
LI,133176-Surfactant,Structure of surfactant phases in water
PA,133176-Surfactant,"In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as micelles, where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or lipid bilayers. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the HLB, Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance. Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water by adsorbing at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the Gibbs isotherm."
LI,133176-Surfactant,Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‘kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The surface rheology of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions."
LI,133176-Surfactant,Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers
PA,133176-Surfactant,Interfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the
H1,133176-Surfactant,-pendant or spinning drop method.
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Dynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the maximum bubble pressure apparatus"
PA,133176-Surfactant,The structure of surfactant layers can be studied by ellipsometry or X-Ray reflectivity.
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Surface rheology can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer."
LI,133176-Surfactant,Detergents in biochemistry and biotechnology
PA,133176-Surfactant,"In solution, detergents help solubilize a variety of chemical species by dissociating aggregates and unfolding proteins. Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are SDS and CTAB. Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as octyl thioglucoside, octyl glucoside or dodecyl maltoside are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as enzymes and receptors without denaturing them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For electrophoresis, for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native tertiary and quaternary structures, allowing the separation of proteins according to their molecular weight."
PA,133176-Surfactant,Detergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats. Pulmonary surfactants are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung alveoli in mammals.
H1,133176-Surfactant,Classification
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The ""tails"" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a hydrocarbon chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. Fluorosurfactants have fluorocarbon chains. Siloxane surfactants have siloxane chains."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Many important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly polar anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated (polyethylene oxide-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. Polypropylene oxides conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Surfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ""double-chained""."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Most commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed zwitterionic. Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:"
H1,133176-Surfactant,Anionic
LI,133176-Surfactant,"Sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate esters"
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Anionic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate, and carboxylates."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Prominent alkyl sulfates include ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates sodium laureth sulfate (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and sodium myreth sulfate."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Others include:
LI,133176-Surfactant,Docusate (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate)
LI,133176-Surfactant,Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)
LI,133176-Surfactant,Perfluorobutanesulfonate
LI,133176-Surfactant,Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates
LI,133176-Surfactant,Alkyl ether phosphates
TI,133176-Surfactant,Carboxylates
PA,133176-Surfactant,"These are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as sodium stearate. More specialized species include sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as perfluorononanoate, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA or PFO)."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Cationic head groups
PA,133176-Surfactant,"pH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary amines; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10: octenidine dihydrochloride."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Permanently charged quaternary ammonium salts: cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), benzethonium chloride (BZT), dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB)."
LI,133176-Surfactant,Zwitterionic surfactants
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Zwitterionic (amphoteric) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule. The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium cations. The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the sultaines CHAPS (3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine. Betaines such as cocamidopropyl betaine have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelins."
H2,133176-Surfactant,Nonionic
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Nonionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of nonionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Nonionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of nonionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, biodegradability) or permission for use in food."

LI,133176-Surfactant,"Anions: tosyls, trifluoromethanesulfonates, methyl sulfate"
LI,133176-Surfactant,In pharmacy
PA,133176-Surfactant,"A wetting agent is a surfactant that, when dissolved in water, lowers the advancing contact angle, aids in displacing an air phase at the surface, and replaces it with a liquid phase. Examples of application of wetting to pharmacy and medicine include the displacement of air from the surface of sulfur, charcoal, and other powders for the purpose of dispersing these drugs in liquid vehicles; the displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas; the displacement of dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds; and the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Pharmaceutical forms
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The human body produces different types of surfactant in different parts or organs for different purposes. Pulmonary surfactant is produced in lungs in order to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, TLC, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS surfactant replacement therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactants is Survanta (beractant) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by Abbvie and Tekzima respectively."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Current market and forecast
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The annual global production of surfactants was 13 million tonnes in 2008. In 2014, the world market for surfactants reached a volume of more than 33 billion US-dollars. Market researchers expect annual revenues to increase by 2.5% per year to around 40.4 billion US-dollars until 2022. The commercially most significant type of surfactants is currently the anionic surfactant alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS), which is widely used in cleaners and detergents."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Health and environmental controversy
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Surfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste. Some of them are known to be toxic to animals, ecosystems, and humans, and can increase the diffusion of other environmental contaminants. As a result, there are proposed or voluntary restrictions on the use of some surfactants. For example, PFOS is a persistent organic pollutant as judged by the Stockholm Convention. Additionally, PFOA has been subject to a voluntary agreement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and eight chemical companies to reduce and eliminate emissions of the chemical and its precursors."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The two major surfactants used in the year 2000 were linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) and the alkyl phenol ethoxylates (APE). They break down in the aerobic conditions found in sewage treatment plants and in soil to the metabolite nonylphenol, which is thought to be an endocrine disruptor."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Ordinary dishwashing detergent, for example, will promote water penetration in soil, but the effect would last only a few days (many standard laundry detergent powders contain levels of chemicals such as alkali and chelating agents that can be damaging to plants and should not be applied to soils). Commercial soil wetting agents will continue to work for a considerable period, but they will eventually be degraded by soil micro-organisms. Some can, however, interfere with the life-cycles of some aquatic organisms, so care should be taken to prevent run-off of these products into streams, and excess product should not be washed down."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as the result of sludge application, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes. Relatively high concentrations of surfactants together with multimetals can represent an environmental risk. At low concentrations, surfactant application is unlikely to have a significant effect on trace metal mobility."
LI,133176-Surfactant,Biosurfactants
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Biosurfactants are surface-active substances synthesised by living cells. Interest in microbial surfactants is due to their diversity, environmentally friendly nature, possibility of large-scale production, selectivity, performance under extreme conditions, and potential applications in environmental protection. A few of the popular examples of microbial biosurfactants includes Emulsan produced by ""Acinetobacter calcoaceticus"", Sophorolipids produced by several yeasts belonging to ""candida"" and the ""starmerella"" clade, and Rhamnolipid produced by ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"" etc."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Biosurfactants enhance the emulsification of hydrocarbons, have the potential to solubilise hydrocarbon contaminants and increase their availability for microbial degradation. The use of chemicals for the treatment of a hydrocarbon polluted site may contaminate the environment with their by-products, whereas biological treatment may efficiently destroy pollutants, while being biodegradable themselves. Hence, biosurfactant-producing microorganisms may play an important role in the accelerated bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites. These compounds can also be used in enhanced oil recovery and may be considered for other potential applications in environmental protection. Other applications include herbicides and pesticides formulations, detergents, healthcare and cosmetics, pulp and paper, coal, textiles, ceramic processing and food industries, uranium ore-processing, and mechanical dewatering of peat."
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Several microorganisms are known to synthesise surface-active agents; most of them are bacteria and yeasts. When grown on hydrocarbon substrate as the carbon source, these microorganisms synthesise a wide range of chemicals with surface activity, such as glycolipid, phospholipid, and others. These chemicals are synthesised to emulsify the hydrocarbon substrate and facilitate its transport into the cells. In some bacterial species such as ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", biosurfactants are also involved in a group motility behavior called swarming motility."
H1,133176-Surfactant,Safety and environmental risks
PA,133176-Surfactant,"Most anionic and nonionic surfactants are nontoxic, having LD50 comparable to sodium chloride. The toxicity of quaternary ammonium compounds, which are antibacterial and antifungal, varies.

LI,133176-Surfactant,"Biosurfactants and ""Deepwater Horizon"""
PA,133176-Surfactant,"The use of biosurfactants as a way to remove petroleum from contaminated sites has been studied and found to be safe and effective in the removal of petroleum products from soil. Other studies found that surfactants are often more toxic than the oil that is being dispersed, and the combination of the oil and the surfactant can be more toxic than either alone. Biosurfactants were not used by BP after the ""Deepwater Horizon"" oil spill. However, unprecedented amounts of Corexit (active ingredient: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monooleate (Tween-80)), were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water's surface, the theory being that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil."

Also agrochemical formulations such as Herbicides (some), insecticides, biocides (sanitizers), and spermicides (nonoxynol-9). Personal care products such as cosmetics, shampoos,shower gel, hair conditioners (after shampoo), toothpastes. Surfactants are used in firefighting and pipelines (liquid drag reducing agents). Alkali surfactant polymers are used to mobilize oil in oil wells). Surfactants are used as plasticizer in nanocellulose Ferrofluids, and leak detectors. Surfactants are used with quantum dots in order to manipulate growth. and assembly of the dots, reactions on their surface, electrical properties, etc., it is important to understand how surfactants arrange on the surface of the quantum dots."

H2,1121432-Quaking-Houses,By C. Small
PA,1121432-Quaking-Houses,"Quaking Houses is a small village near to the town of Stanley in County Durham, in England. It may have been originally settled by Quakers, but during the Industrial Revolution it developed into a mining village with traditional terraced houses. The Quaker origin is supported by the 1873 name for a mine with two shafts at the village called Quaker House Pit. However, an alternative origin is suggested by the following; the 1865 OS Map shows a farm called Quaking House to the north at Anfield Plain and a colliery railway line ran past this farm branching to the village mine. This colliery railway line was called the Quaking House Branch Line. A colloquial name for the village was ""banana goat island"" perhaps reflecting the livestock kept in the extensive allotments and grazing area around the village."
PA,1121432-Quaking-Houses,"Accessible by road only from the main South Moor Road, the village is dominated by one large road, with large strips of terraced housing on either side, both facing outwards. The large road is divided into several different street names: Third Street and Fourth Street, with Woodside Terrace and Fellside Terrace located at the west end. A large turning circle enables large vehicles, particularly buses, to change direction."
PA,1121432-Quaking-Houses,"A shorter road parallel to the large road once had two streets, First Street and Second Street. The Community Hall which opened in 1997 stands where First street was once situated and Second Street still remains. The original housing stock was tied property which passed to the National Coal Board following nationalisation of the coal industry. The properties in Fellside and Woodside Terrace were larger than the other properties and were originally occupied by people with ""middle management"" occupations in the mining industry. As the cheryl coal mining industry declined these properties were progressively sold off into private ownership. In the 1960s, Quaking Houses was declared a Category D village under the County Durham development plan. Category D villages were to be left to die with the mining industry and planning consents for further development were to be refused. The Category D policy waned over time and new housing development has taken place."
PA,1121432-Quaking-Houses,"At one time at the bottom of Fourth Street stood a walled reservoir and at the top of the village on the fell in the woodland was a dam, both of which had been required for the mines in the area. The William Pit, colloquially known as the Billy Pit, and which, prior to nationalisation, was owned by the South Moor and Holmside Colliery Company [SM&HCC] stood near the reservoir. SM&HCC also operated a drift mine in the Stanley Burn valley to the north of Woodside Terrace."
PA,1121432-Quaking-Houses,"Quaking Houses fell, which is an outstanding example of lowland heath, sweeps down towards Fourth Street and Fellside Terrace."
PA,1121432-Quaking-Houses,The village is often colloquially referred to as 'Quackie’s'. It is adjacent to the larger village of South Moor.
